# Pure Data

This is the README file for Pd, a free real-time computer music system.

## Getting Pd

You can get Pd for Linux, macOS, or Microsoft Windows from:

    http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html

or from the Pure Data community site:

    https://puredata.info

Installation instructions are in INSTALL.txt and the HTML documentation at:

    http://msp.ucsd.edu/Pd_documentation/index.htm

If you download and unpack Pd, you will also find the HTML documentation
locally in the file "doc/1.manual/index.htm".

Linux (or FreeBSD): In some Linux installations you can download Pd via "apt-get
install puredata" or "dnf install puredata"; otherwise you can download
the source and compile it as described in INSTALL.txt.

Apple macOS: Pd binaries are distributed as a "tar.gz" file. The web browser
will probably download this archive into your Downloads folder. Double click
to extract the archived Mac app which you can then run and/or drag into your
Applications folder.

Microsoft Windows: Pd binaries are distributed as a self-extracting executable
or as a "zip" file.

If you have questions about Pd or if you wish to be notified of releases,
you can browse and/or join the Pd mailing list:

    https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo

Many extensions to Pd are available, for instance to add video and 3D graphics.
The easiest way to get these is to use the "Find externals" command in Pd's Help
menu.
