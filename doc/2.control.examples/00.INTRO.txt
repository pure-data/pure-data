This series of patches serves as a tutorial for Pd's "control" structure, as
opposed to its audio functions (covered in the next series.)  These tutorials
are inspired by Chris Dobrian's Max tutorial patches.

It's probably best to look at the first section here before going on to the
audio portion, but afterward there's no reason not to browse back and forth
between the two, and even the third series on "fft" based techniques.

The relationship between "control" and "audio" is described in Pd's HTML
documentation, which is more like a reference manual than an introduction.
Also, you probably will need to look there to get Pd up and running stably so
that you can enjoy the patches here.

The patches are roughly divided as shown:

1. objects and connections
2. subpatches, tables, and organization
3. specific techniques.
