#X text 44 122 When you first open a Pd document like this one \, your
cursor will be an arrow. Select "edit mode" in the Edit menu and the
cursor will change to the image of a hand. The patch is now in edit
mode. You can move any object by dragging it., f 63;
#X text 44 191 Select "Edit mode" again in the Edit menu and you're
back to the arrow cursor which acts on objects without moving them.
, f 63;
#X text 44 231 In Edit mode \, if you click on a message \, object
\, or comment \, you can then retype the text. For objects this will
create a new object and delete the old one. Pd will try to reconnect
the newly created object in the same way as the old one., f 63;
#X text 44 301 When you're done changing the contents of the box \,
click outside the box to deselect it. This tells Pd to incorporate
the new text., f 63;
#X text 44 356 You can create new objects by duplicating existing ones
using the "duplicate" menu item. You can also "cut" and "paste" them.
If you duplicate several connected objects the connections will be
replicated too., f 63;
#X text 44 422 Edit mode also lets you make and break connections between
objects. Put the "hand" cursor over a line connecting two objects:
it turns into an X. Clicking will select the connection \, which you
can delete with the delete key \, or "Cut" from the "Edit" menu. Hold
the cursor over an outlet and it becomes a circle (a patch point).
Drag to any box and release--you will be connected to the nearest inlet.

#X text 44 531 The "put" menu creates new text items of any of the
four types. Note that there are other GUI boxes in this menu \, like
the list box than can hold one or more atoms. An atom in Pd is a message
item \, usually either a float or a symbol. The put menu also offers
a "symbol" atom box \, a GUI box analogous to the atom number box but
for showing and entering single text strings. Other GUIs like bang
\, toggle are also in this menu \, as well as arrays and graphs (which
we'll see later on)., f 63;
