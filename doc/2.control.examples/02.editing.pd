#X text 34 102 When you first open a Pd document like this one \, your cursor will be an arrow. Select "edit mode" in the Edit menu and the cursor will change to the image of a hand. The patch is now in edit mode. You can move any object by dragging it.;
#X text 34 175 Select "Edit mode" again in the Edit menu and you're back to the arrow cursor which acts on objects without moving them.;
#X text 34 217 In Edit mode \, if you click on a message \, object \, or comment \, you can then retype the text. For objects this will create a new object and delete the old one. Pd will try to reconnect the newly created object in the same way as the old one.;
#X text 34 295 When you're done changing the contents of the box \, click outside the box to deselect it. This tells Pd to incorporate the new text.;
#X text 34 353 You can create new objects by duplicating existing ones using the "duplicate" menu item. You can also "cut" and "paste" them. If you duplicate several connected objects the connections will be replicated too.;
#X text 34 427 Edit mode also lets you make and break connections between objects. Put the "hand" cursor over a line connecting two objects: it turns into an X. Clicking will select the connection \, which you can delete with the delete key \, or "Cut" from the "Edit" menu. Hold the cursor over an outlet and it becomes a circle (a patch point). Drag to any box and release--you will be connected to the nearest inlet.;
#X text 34 550 The "put" menu creates new text items of any of the four types. You can also put a "symbol" box \, analogous to a number box but for showing and entering text strings.;
