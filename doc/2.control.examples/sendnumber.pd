#X text 154 103 When you call an abstraction by typing \, say \, "sendnumber
1 x" in an object box. the subpatch can access the values of the creation
arguments (1 and x) as "$1" and "$2" inside object boxes. Typing \$1
inside a message box has a different meaning (see the message box help
window.);
#X text 155 31 This window is used by 11.subpatch.pd to demonstrate
the abstraction mechanism in Pd. If you've opened this window directly
\, you might also want to open the other one to see how it's used.
