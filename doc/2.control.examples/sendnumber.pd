#X text 180 102 When you call an abstraction by typing \, say \, "sendnumber
1 x" in an object box. the subpatch can access the values of the creation
arguments (1 and x) as "\$1" and "\$2" inside object boxes. Typing
\$1 inside a message box has a different meaning (see the message box
help window.);

the abstraction mechanism in Pd. If you've opened this window directly
\, you might also want to open the other one to see how it's used.
