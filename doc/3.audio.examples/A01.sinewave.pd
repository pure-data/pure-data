#X text 42 226 Audio computation can be turned on and off by sending messages to the global "pd" object as follows:, f 56;

#X text 123 314 ON;
#X text 232 314 OFF;
#X text 39 353 You should see the Pd window change to reflect whether audio is on or off. You can also turn audio on and off using the "audio" menu \, but the buttons are provided as a shortcut.;
#X text 40 405 When DSP is on \, you should hear a tone whose pitch is A 440 and whose amplitude is 0.05. If instead you are greeted with silence \, you might want to read the HTML documentation on setting up audio.;
#X text 40 471 In general when you start a work session with Pd \, you will want to choose "test audio and MIDI" from the help window \, which opens a more comprehensive test patch than this one., f 60;
#X text 28 44 Audio computation in Pd is done using "tilde objects" such as the three below. They use continuous audio streams to intercommunicate \, as well as communicating with other ("control") Pd objects using messages.;
