#X text 42 226 Audio computation can be turned on and off by sending
messages to the global "pd" object as follows:, f 56;
#X msg 108 277 \; pd dsp 1;
#X msg 212 277 \; pd dsp 0;
#X text 123 314 ON;
#X text 232 314 OFF;
#X text 39 344 You should see the Pd window change to reflect whether
audio is on or off. You can also turn audio on and off using the "audio"
menu \, but the buttons are provided as a shortcut.;
#X text 40 396 When DSP is on \, you should hear a tone whose pitch
is A 440 and whose amplitude is 0.05. If instead you are greeted with
silence \, you might want to read the HTML documentation on setting
up audio.;
#X text 40 462 In general when you start a work session with Pd \,
you will want to choose "test audio and MIDI" from the help window
\, which opens a more comprehensive test patch than this one., f 60
;
#X text 28 44 Audio computation in Pd is done using "tilde objects"
such as the three below. They use continuous audio streams to intercommunicate
\, as well as communicating with other ("control") Pd objects using
messages.;
#X text 291 536 updated for Pd version 0.36;
#X text 296 285 <= click these;
#X text 165 188 <=== send to the audio output device;
