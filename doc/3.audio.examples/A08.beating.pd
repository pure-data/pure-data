#X text 118 14 Beating between closely tuned sinusoids;
#X text 43 305 In each of the three pairs of oscillators above \, the two frequencies are within 1/3 Hz or closer (for example \, the leftmost ones are close to 330 Hz but separated by 1/5 Hz.) The result is a gradual change in amplitude as the phases of the two slip against each other. This is called beating. More complex beating patterns may be made by using three or more oscillators. Also their amplitudes need not be equal (as they are here).;
#X text 41 432 They are all summed using "+~" boxes. They could have been summed in any order ("+~" is commutative for practical purposes) but here they are added in pairs to emphasize the relationships between them.;
#X text 40 499 In contrast to the previous example \, the oscillators are not tuned to the overtone series (ratios 1:2:3:4...) and so the frequencies 330 \, 440 \, and 587 are heard separately.;
