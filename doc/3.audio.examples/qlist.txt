# This is a qlist for patch number 68, which demonstrates an oscillator
bank.
;
# comments start with a "#" which must be followed by a space.  The comment
is terminated by a semicolon like this: ;

# first an arpeggio.  You can group them in lines as you please.  The 100s at
the beginnings of lines are delay times. ;
