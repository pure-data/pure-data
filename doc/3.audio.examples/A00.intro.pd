#X text 82 318 Note \, however \, that the book was designed for an older version of Pd. The examples here part of this version of Pd are more up to date and include more recent features and functionalities \, so they are somewhat different from the book's examples. Nonetheless \, the link above carries a download for the exact example files that were used on the book. One way or another \, these more up to date examples should correspond to the theory presented in the book without significant conflicts.;
