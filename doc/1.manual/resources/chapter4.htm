<H2>Chapter 4: Externals</H2>

<p> This chapter explains what are external objects and libraries. It also
describes everything on how to install and load them in Pure Data.

<P>Pure Data, by intent and design, has a lightweight and portable nature.
Most likely you'll need or want to install externals to enhance Pd's
capabilities. Luckily, Pd offers a wide range of external packages by
third party developers that enhance its capabilities. Most of these are
primarily focused on audio and control processing, like "Ceammc", "Cyclone",
"ELSE", "FFTease", "Flucoma", "IEMlib", "Pmpd", "TimbreID", "Zexy", and
many more. The "vstplugin~" external allows you to run VST plugins inside Pd.
External libraries for graphical processing include Mark Dank's "GEM" and Zack
Lee's "Ofelia", which allows you to use openFrameworks and the Lua programming
language within Pd for creating audiovisual artwork or multimedia applications
such as games.

<p> You can write your own external objects that you and others can use in
their Pd applications in C or (if you're smart and brave) in C++ or FORTRAN.
In the "6.externs" subdirectory of the 'doc' folder you can find simple
examples of externals with their source code and test patches. This is also
accessible via the browser window.

<p>There’s also an excellent guide to writing externals at
<a href="https://github.com/pure-data/externals-howto">
https://github.com/pure-data/externals-howto</a>, written
by IOhannes zmölnig . Check also the pd-lib-builder project
(a helper makefile for Pure Data external libraries by Katja
Vetter) at <a href="http://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder">
http://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder</a>.

<H3> <A href="#s4.1" id="s4.1"> 4.1 External Objects & Libraries </A> </H3>

<p> We start this section by defining what are internals and externals.
The main Pd distribution (a.k.a. “Pd Vanilla”) actually comes with both
internals and externals.

<H4> <A href="#s4.1.1" id="s4.1.1"> 4.1.1 Vanilla objects, internals & externals </A> </H4>

<p> Internal objects come as part of the Pd binary, whereas external objects
are separate from it. Pd Vanilla also comes with a few “extra” objects that
are not part of its binary. Therefore, the set of “vanilla objects” (the
built-in objects in Pd) include internals and externals. Nonetheless,
“externals” mostly refer objects not available in the Pd Vanilla distribution,
that you need to download and install them properly so they can be loaded into
Pd patches. Some other flavors of Pd usually come with pre installed externals.

<p> To get a full list of all objects in Pd Vanilla, go to the <b>Help menu</b> and
then select <b>List of Objects</b>, or alternatively right click on an empty spot of a
patch’s window and select “help” - this loads the help-intro.pd file that was already
shown in <a href="chapter1.htm">Chapter 1: Introduction</a> and reproduced below.

    <figcaption><u>Fig. 1.2.3</u> The "help-intro' patch with a list of all internal objects</figcaption>
</figure>


<p> The set of externals that come with Pd Vanilla is available in the ‘extra’ library
and is located in a folder named “extra” inside the Pd application. These appear at the
very end of the “help-intro.pd” and can also be viewed in the "Browser" menu entry in
the <b>Help menu</b>. See figure below, which shows how the browser looks in a fresh
install of Pd and lists the objects in the extra folder.

</figure>

<H4> <A href="#s4.1.2" id="s4.1.2"> 4.1.2. Types of external objects </A> </H4>

<p> An object in Pd can be either a patch file (an abstraction) or a
compiled binary. Nonetheless, a binary can contain only one or several
external objects, as discussed below.

<H5> <A href="#s4.1.2.1" id="s4.1.2.1"> 4.1.2.1. Compiled objects</A> </H5>

<p> Compiled objects are binaries compiled from code (like C or C++).
They have to be compiled to match your Pd application. Pd is made available for
different Operating Systems, namely Linux, macOS and Windows. Moreover, it is
available for different CPU architectures and numerical precision (32-bit or 64-bit
floats aka "single-precision floating point numbers" or "double-precision floating
point numbers" respectively "single" or "double").

<p>In <A href="chapter3.htm">Chapter 3: Installing and configuring Pd</A> you can see
how to download different Pd applications. Most commonly, you'll have Pd installed
as a 64-bit application, which corresponds to most recent systems.

<p>A Pd application compiled for 32-bit systems is mostly suited to run old externals
that were not yet compiled for 64-bit systems. Most relevant and maintained externals
are provided for 64-bit systems though; but of course, there can be cases where one is
running Pd on an (old) system that only supports 32-bit applications.

<p>Also, at this point, Pure Data does not officially support double-precision numbers.
You can download <b>Pd64</b> beta releases or compile them yourself though (for
compilation instructions, see <A href="chapter6.htm">Chapter 6: Building Pd from source</A>).
Note that the numerical resolution of Pd and Pd64 here must not be confused with the
register size of the system it's running on.

<p>The Pd64 application requires specially compiled externals. As this is a recent
development and not yet fully supported, only a few libraries are currently available.

<p>You can have externals for different operating systems, architectures, and even
for single- and double-precision numbers (i.e., for Pd and Pd64) in the same folder with
different file extensions. Refer to the table below for common combinations:

<H5> <A href="#s4.1.2.2" id="s4.1.2.2"> 4.1.2.2. Abstractions</A> </H5>

<p>You can have a Pd patch behave like an object by loading it into other
patches - these are usually called “abstractions” (see
<A href="chapter2.htm#s2.8.1">2.8.1. Abstractions</A>). Note that some of the
externals in “extra” are abstractions (for instance, <b>[rev1~]</b> or <b>[hilbert~]</b>).
Like any other Pd patch, an abstraction may contain any kind of objects
(internals, compiled externals and even other abstractions).

<H4> <A href="#s4.1.3" id="s4.1.3"> 4.1.3. External libraries </A> </H4>

<p>In practical terms, an external library is a collection of external objects
of any kind (abstractions or compiled objects). But when it comes to compiled
objects, a library can provide several objects as a <b>single binary pack</b>
or as a <b>set of separate binaries</b> (where each object has its own binary).

<p>The “classic” library format is a single binary pack (with two or more
externals), but splitting into separate binaries became a very common
practice. A single external binary (not part of any set of objects) is still,
technically, a library with just one object. But again, the prevailing idea is
that a library is just a set of objects.

<p> It’s important to note that there are differences on how externals are
loaded depending if they’re a single binary pack or a set of separate binaries
(as explained in the next subsections).

<H4> <A href="#s4.1.4" id="s4.1.4"> 4.1.4. Types of external libraries </A> </H4>

<p>Libraries can come in all sorts of ways; as only a collection of
abstractions (like "list-abs"), only compiled objects, or both. It can even mix
compiled externals both as a <b>set of separate binaries</b> and a <b>single binary
pack</b>. Basically, any combination is possible for a set of externals.

<p>One example that combines all external options is <i>Cyclone</i> (since version 0.3),
which provides most of its objects as a <b>set of separate binaries</b>, but also includes
a small collection of 12 objects as a <b>single binary pack</b> plus a couple of abstractions.

<H4> <A href="#s4.1.5" id="s4.1.5"> 4.1.5. Wrapping up section 4.1</A> </H4>

<p>In short, we have:

<UL>
	<LI> <b>Internal objects:</b> Objects that are part of Pd Vanilla's binary.
	<LI> <b>External objects:</b> Objects that are <u>NOT</u> part of Pd Vanilla's binary.
	<LI> <b>Vanilla objects:</b> Built-in objects in the Pd Vanilla distribution
(including internals and a small collection of externals - the "extra" objects).
	<LI> <b>Types of external objects:</b> Compiled binaries or abstractions.
	<LI> <b>External library:</b> Collection of external objects in any form, be it a
<u>single binary pack</u> containing several objects, a <u>set of separate binaries</u> /
abstractions or any combination of these.
</UL>
<br>
<br>

<H3> <A href="#s4.2" id="s4.2">4.2. GUI (.tcl) plugins </A> </H3>

<p>There's also a catefgory of GUI externals, mostly known as "GUI plugins".
These are .tcl file extensions that offer extra GUI features for the Pd
application.

<p>These plugins are normally offered with the plugin name appended by
"-plugin". For example: "completion-plugin", a plugin for autocompleting
objcet names. Another interesting plugin is the "patcherize-plugin",
which turns bits of patches into subpatches or abstractions. These need
to be placed in a search path that Pd knows about (see details in next
section). These plugins are then automatically loaded when Pd starts up.

<p>The actual filename is then something like "completion-plugin.tcl" and
it comes inside a folder with the same name (completion-plugin). In this
situation, Pd knows to search inside that folder for the plugin!

<H3> <A href="#s4.3" id="s4.3">4.3. Installing externals and GUI plugins </A> </H3>

<p>Installing externals and GUI plugins in Pd is quite simple, all you need
to do is download them from somewhere (such as from Pd directly as explained
later) and include them in a proper folder.

<H4> <A href="#s4.3.1" id="s4.3.1"> 4.3.1. Where to include externals and GUI plugins</A> </H4>

<p>Currently, when launching for the first time with a fresh install, Pd asks if
you want to create a documents directory for patches that includes an “externals”
subdirectory. This externals folder is where it’s advised to include externals
and GUI plugins. This path is automatically included in the user added
search paths (under the 'Path' tab in Preferences), see figure below.

<figure>
    <IMG src="4.3.1.png" ALT="Preferences">
    <figcaption><u>Fig. 4.3.1</u> The Path preferences with a few user added paths</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see in the screenshot above that the “Pd” folder is created
under ~/Documents, and inside it we have the "externals" subfolder.
Even if you did not create this folder, here is where you can create it
by clicking the “Reset” button under “Pd Documents Directory”. The picture
also shows other paths for external libraries, all inside the
~/Documents/Pd/externals.

<p>Externals can actually be anywhere in your computer, but Pd must
know where to look for them. Pd looks for files (including externals) in the
user added search paths, but it also searches in other folders not listed there
such as: the same folder that your patch is saved on (the <u>Relative Path</u>)
and the <u>Standard Paths</u>. Note the "Use standard paths" toggle in the picture
above, which is on by default. This tells Pd to use these paths, which are:

<UL>
	<LI>A) <u>Application-specific</u>: The "extra" folder inside a particular Pure Data
application.
	<LI>B) <u>User-specific</u>: A system folder for a specific user in the machine.
	<LI>C) <u>Global</u>: A system folder for all users on the machine.
</UL>

<p>Officially, there’s only one ‘Standard Path’ which is the ‘extra’ folder.
The others are not automatically created by Pd and are part of an old
structure. Currently, the best practice is to use the default external folders or
user added paths, but these other options are documented here anyway and
may be useful in some edge cases.


<p>The <u>Global</u> folder affects all Pure Data Applications for all users.
The <u>User-specific</u> folder affects all Pure Data Applications for that user.
And since you can have different versions of Pd installed in your system, the
<u>Application-specific</u> folder affects only that particular Pd Application
- multiple Pd applications can be of different versions (an older and a newer
one or both single and double precision variants). For reference, here’s the
list of the Standard Paths for all operating systems:

<p>A) macOS:
<UL>
	<LI><u>Application-specific</u>: <mark><b>/$PdPath/Contents/Resources/extra</b></mark> - this is
inside the Pd Application (like Pd-0.49-1 in ~/Applications); right click it and
choose "Show Package Contents", then navigate to "extra".
	<LI><u>User-specific</u>: <mark><b>~/Library/Pd</b></mark> (/Users/user_name/Library/Pd)
	<LI><u>Global</u>: <mark><b>/Library/Pd</b></mark>

</UL>

<p>B) Windows:
<UL>
	<LI><u>Application-specific</u>: <mark><b> %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Pd\extra</b></mark> (for 64-bit
OS and 32-bit Pd) or %ProgramFiles%\Pd\extra; this is
inside the Pd Application (usually in C:\Program Files).
This folder needs to be set to writeable.
	<LI><u>User-specific</u>: <mark><b> %AppData%\Pd</b></mark>
(usually in C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Pd).
	<LI><u>Global</u>: <mark><b> %CommonProgramFiles%\Pd</b></mark>
(usually in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Pd).

</UL>

C) GNU/Linux:

<UL>

	<LI><u>Application-specific</u>: <mark><b> /usr/lib/pd/extra</b></mark> if installed via a package
manager (apt-get) or /usr/local/lib/pd/extra if compiled by yourself.
	<LI><u>User-specific</u>: <mark><b> ~/.local/lib/pd/extra</b></mark> (preferred since version Pd-0.47-1)
or ~/pd-externals (deprecated but still usable).
	<LI><u>Global</u>: <mark><b> /usr/local/lib/pd-externals</b></mark>.
</UL>

<H4> <A href="#s4.3.2" id="s4.3.2"> 4.3.2. How to download externals and GUI plugins from Pd</A> </H4>

<p>Since version 0.47-0, Pd Vanilla has its own external manager! This is a built in
.tcl plug-in named "deken" (check <a href="https://github.com/pure-data/deken">
https://github.com/pure-data/deken</a> for reference). Open it by selecting the
"Find externals" entry from the <b>Help menu</b>. Then you can type and search for an
object name, a library name or both. The wildcard '*' can be used to broaden the search,
or an exact name can be used instead. All available versions of the library/external
specific for your operating system will be shown to you. See figure below. Note that
you can also download GUI plugins from deken. Search for '*-plugin' to get a list of
all options.

<figure>
    <IMG src="4.3.2.png" ALT="deken install">
    <figcaption><u>Fig. 4.3.2</u> Installing external libraries from 'deken'</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When you double-click on library and version you want, by default Pd downloads it to
"~/Documents/Pd/externals". Note you can click on multiple libraries and download
them at the same time. Note also you can search for multiple objects and libraries by
separating the search entries with commas.

<figure>
    <IMG src="4.3.3.png" ALT="installing multiple libraries">
    <figcaption><u>Fig. 4.3.3</u> Installing multiple libraries at once</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Moreover, if you have a an object creation error in the console, you can
<kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>click</kbd> on the error and it will open the plugin
manager with a prompt search for the missing object ready to go.

<figure>
    <IMG src="4.3.4.png" ALT="searching object for creation error">
    <figcaption><u>Fig. 4.3.4</u> Searching object in the plugin manager via the console window error</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note that when the external manager window is focused, there are
dedicated menus: <b>File</b> and <b>Edit</b>. You can use <b>File</b>
to open and install a ".dek" file, and <b>Edit</b> to open "Preferences"
for the plugin manager. For macOS these menus are on the top bar.

<figure>
    <IMG src="4.3.5.png" ALT="plugin manager menus">
    <figcaption><u>Fig. 4.3.5</u> The plugin manager's menus</figcaption>

<p>And the plugin manager's preferences are as follows:

<figure>
    <IMG src="4.3.6.png" ALT="deken preferences">
    <figcaption><u>Fig. 4.3.6</u> The plugin manager's preferences</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The above are the default settings. If you want to see results that are not
suited for your system, uncheck "Hide foreign architectures". If you want to
find older versions of the library, uncheck "Only show the newest version of
a library".

<H3> <A href="#s4.4" id="s4.4">4.4. Loading externals </A> </H3>

<p>The current best practice is to use the <b>[declare]</b> object to search for,
load and manage externals, but there are alternatives.

<p>If the object is from a library that is distributed as a single binary pack,
this binary needs to be pre loaded at start time by Pd, so it can create its
externals. This is done either with <b>[declare]</b> or manually via the 'Startup' tab
in Preferences.

<p>If the external library only contains abstractions or objects compiled as
a set of separate binaries, Pd just needs to know its path. Again, this can be
done via <b>[declare]</b> or manually via the 'Path' tab in Preferences, but yet
another option here is to use slash declarations as we'll see later.

<H4> <A href="#s4.4.1" id="s4.4.1">4.4.1. Using the <b>[declare]</b> object</A> </H4>

<p>The <b>[declare]</b> object can be used to add search paths or load libraries. When
adding a path, it behaves quite similarly to adding search paths to the
user added paths via the 'Path' tab in Preferences. The difference is that this
will only work for the patch that contains this <b>[declare]</b> object - unlike using
Path preferences, which loads the path(s) permanently for any patch.

<p>As for loading a library, once Pd loads it (via <b>[declare]</b> or startup) it
sticks with it. This means that if you use <b>[declare]</b> to load a library, it will
also be loaded if you create a new patch without any <b>[declare]</b> object.

<H5> <A href="#s4.4.1.1" id="s4.4.1.1">4.4.1.1. [declare -path]</A> </H5>

<p>Let's take for an example the <a href="http://github.com/porres/pd-else"> ELSE</a>
library. This library mostly contains separate binaries and abstractions, so Pd only
needs to know its location path to load them. We then use the '-path' flag as in
[declare -path else]. This makes Pd look for a folder named 'else' to add it to the
search path for that patch only.If it succeeds, this is where Pd will prioritize the
search of objects and other files, moving on to other possible search places if
nothing is found.

<p>But where does Pd look for the 'else' folder? Well, the -path flag is first meant
to search in the Relative Path, but if it doesn't find it, it falls back to the
User Added Paths and Standard Paths. So let’s say you put the ELSE library folder in
“~/Documents/Pd/externals”, which is the current best practice, Pd will know to look
for it there and will find it!

<p> Now, in the case of a single external, the best practice is to include it in
a folder with the same name in “~/Documents/Pd/externals”. An example, the <b>[freeverb~]</b>
external should be in “~/Documents/Pd/externals/freeverb~”. In this situation, you don’t
need to add the external folder to the path, manually or use <b>[declare]</b>. This is because
when you tell Pd to look for an external, if it finds a folder with the same name as the
external, it'll know to search inside that folder for the external!

<H5> <A href="#s4.4.1.2" id="s4.4.1.2"> 4.4.1.2. [declare -lib]</A> </H5>

<p>The '-lib' flag is needed for the classic Pd library format, which
is a single binary pack with many externals. One such example is the
<a href="https://git.iem.at/pd/zexy/"> Zexy </a> library. So you should
download and have the 'zexy' folder in “~/Documents/Pd/externals/zexy”.
Now you can use <b>[declare -lib zexy]</b> to load the external binary. In the
same way as explained with the <b>[freeverb~]</b> example, the binary is inside
a folder with the same name. So Pd will search for the external in
“~/Documents/Pd/externals", will find the 'zexy' folder and know to
search for the zexy binary in it. This means you don't need to bother in
using <b>[declare]</b> to define the search path.

<p>Note that it may be possible for you to load a library binary as an object
if the developer wished to. But it's still advisable to use either "Startup"
or <b>[declare -lib]</b>, because this way you are sure the library is preloaded
before Pd tries to create other objects in your patch.

<p>The ELSE library also offers a binary for you to load as a library. This is
a very special case as this binary does not actually load any external. What
it actually loads are some .tcl plugins that add an object browser at right
clicking on a patch canvas. It also prints information about the release on
the Console window. Moreover, you can also load <b>[else]</b> as an object in a patch
and it offers the functionality of outputting its version for you to check in
the patch if it is the correct one.

<p>The Cyclone library also allows you to load <b>[cyclone]</b> as an object and
offers the same version output functionality as in ELSE.

<p>For more details on how <b>[declare]</b> works, please check its help file!

<H4> <A href="#s4.4.2" id="s4.4.2"> 4.4.2. Load via path and startup</A> </H4>

<p>We'll now see the differences between using <b>[declare]</b> or using "Path" and
"Startup" tabs in Preferences.

<H5> <A href="#s4.4.2.1" id="s4.4.2.1"> 4.4.2.1. User added path</A> </H5>

<p>One big difference in adding a search path in 'Preferences' is that this
permanently adds the path and works every time Pd starts and for any patch
you open. When you use <b>[declare]</b>, the path is loaded only for its owning
patch and loaded abstractions. Moreover, if you have an abstraction with
[declare -path], it'll only work for that abstraction and not the parent
patch! Hence, <b>[declare]</b> allows a much better control and management of
paths. But you may want to permanently add a path in your own system if
you know exactly what you have and what you need.

<p>We’ve seen that even if you have a folder in “~/Documents/Pd/externals”
you still need to tell Pd to look for it. You can manually add a User Added
Paths in Preferences => Path by clicking “New”.

<p>Another possibility is that under deken’s preferences tabs you can click
on “Add newly installed libraries to Pd’s search Path”, which adds downloaded
libraries to the user added search paths (see picture above).

<p>Note also that having a user added search path will not make it have search
priority like it happens when you use <b>[declare]</b>. In this case, the path relative
to the patch will have top priority!

<H5> <A href="#s4.4.2.2" id="s4.4.2.2"> 4.4.2.2. Startup</A> </H5>

<p>"Preferences => Startup" loads a window that says <i>"Pd libraries to load
on startup"</i>. This is where you can manually and permanently load single
binary pack libraries. But since they're only needed during startup, you need
to restart Pd so this takes effect. The startup is also used for configuring
Pd in many ways, see <a href="chapter3.htm#s3.4.1">3.4.1 Startup flags</a> for
details.

    <figcaption><u>Fig. 4.4.1</u> The Startup preferences with library binaries to load</figcaption>
</figure>

<p> As we’ve seen with ‘zexy’, it’s common that the name of the binary is
the same as the library’s, so you don’t need to worry about adding it to the
path. There are many other examples in the picture above. One particularity
<a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/Gem"> Gem </a> is that it also forces
Pd to add its path to the search paths, which is needed for some abstractions
and then you don’t need to bother adding it to the path. Note, however, that
unlike using <b>[declare]</b>, this does not enforce a top search priority! Hence,
for example, you may prefer to use <b>[declare -path Gem -lib Gem]</b> instead.

<p>It all depends on the developer, but it is a common and good practice that
when you load a library, Pd’s terminal window will print something to tell us
that the libraries were loaded successfully. Here’s a screenshot of the result
of loading cyclone.

<figure>
    <IMG src="4.4.2.png" ALT="lib print">
    <figcaption><u>Fig. 4.4.2</u> Library loading printout</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note that when you load a library via Startup or <b>[declare -lib]</b>, all of its
external objects are loaded in Pd and they have search priority over other
externals that are loaded via paths. This may cause issues discussed on the
next section.

<H4> <A href="#s4.4.3" id="s4.4.3"> 4.4.3. Load using slash declarations</A> </H4>

<p>Let’s say you’ve downloaded the ELSE library into ~/Documents/Pd/externals.
Instead of using <b>[declare -path else]</b> or adding the ELSE folder to the user
added paths manually, you can just prepend “else/“ before an object name. This
will make Pd look for this object in a folder called ‘else’ in one of its search
paths (which includes ~/Documents/Pd/externals) and find it! Here’s an example:

<figure>
    <IMG src="4.4.3.png" ALT="slash declaration">
    <figcaption><u>Fig. 4.4.3</u> An external object with a slash declaration</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This can be an option that some people may prefer for the simple fact that
it's just clearer from which library folder we're loading the external. But
there are some rare cases where this is the only way to guarantee you have
loaded the correct external, which is a problem when you have too many
libraries in your system and are using more than one that has an external
with the same name. Hence, some external libraries like 'Cyclone' and 'ELSE'
use this in the documentation of the help files to make sure you load the
correct external.

<p>Note, however, that this is not possible for an external that is loaded as
part of a single binary pack, unless the developer uses a workaround to add
this possibility as alternative.

<p>The issue with <b>[declare]</b> or adding a path to the user added paths is that
it'll respect a search order. Whatever path is added first in the search list
order has a priority, and where ever Pd finds an external first, it'll load
it and stop searching elsewhere. Again, this kind of problem is not that
common, but you can solve this with slash declarations. You may also be able
to sort this issue by setting the desired order. This is quite easy in
<b>[declare]</b> as which ever -path comes first in the list has a priority, so you
can try that if you want to avoid slash declarations when you run into this
rare issue.

<p>Name clash conflicts can also happen when you're loading single binary
pack libraries. The problem is that once they get loaded, all of its external
objects are now part of Pd and have a priority in the search. Here's an
example, the 'ceammc' library is a single binary pack and it included an
object called <b>[xfade~]</b>. The ELSE library has separate binaries for each
object and also has one called <b>[xfade~]</b>. If you're using both libraries,
ceammc's <b>[xfade~]</b> object will have priority and it doesn't help you to have
[declare -path else].


<p>It was mentioned how a library name prefix may also be possible in the
context of single binary packs. The ceammc library offers this, so you can
also load its <b>[xfade~]</b> object as <b>[ceammc/xfade~]</b>. But note that this still
requires you to preload the binary (via startup or <b>[declare]</b>). The slash
declaration here was only possible because the developer added the
'ceammc/xfade~' name as an alternative option in the code. So it is just a
hack to improve the limitation of Pd in handling namespaces. Another library
that does this is Cyclone, which carries a sublibrary with 12 objects with
non alphanumeric names, such as <b>[>~]</b>. By using the same trick, you can create
the <b>[>~]</b> object as <b>[cyclone/>~]</b>. Another single binary pack library that has
<b>[>~]</b> is zexy, so this way you can make sure you're getting cyclone's instead.

<p>These issues might be clear if you better understand how Pd works when
loading externals. See next subsection.

<H3> <A href="#s4.5" id="s4.5">4.5. How external binaries are loaded</A> </H3>

<p>Once you make sure Pd can load an external binary via a path, this is what
happens when you create it. Whenever you create an object that Pd
doesn't yet know about, Pd looks for the object file named as, for
instance, "profile.pd_linux". Pd looks first in a path defined by
<b>[declare]</b> (if any, of course), then in the directory containing
the patch, then in directories listed as user added paths in the
order they are listed, then in the standard paths. As soon as Pd
finds the object in this search order, it'll stop searching further
more and will add the found object to its "class list", which is
the set of all Pd classes you can use. Pd then tries to create the
object you asked for, and if everything is fine with it, this
happens successfully (creation errors are given otherwise).

<p>In the case of a single binary pack loaded at Startup or with
<b>[declare]</b>, all the externals it contains get preloaded in Pd's class
list, even though they're only created in object boxes when you
require them.

<p>In both cases, once an external object's binary is in Pd's memory,
there is no real difference between it and a native object. They're
all seen equally now in Pd. Once a new separate binary or single binary
pack is loaded, it's there for the duration of your Pd session. This
means that if you replace the binaries, the objects won't be updated
even if you recreate them. You can also even delete the binary as Pd
now carries it for good in its memory. Hence, if you're working on the
development of an object's binary and decide to change it, you have to
exit and re-enter Pd to get the change to take effect.

<p>Let us just make the distinction that external abstractions work
quite differently! As they get updated any time they’re updated and
reloaded!


<H4> <A href="#s4.5.1" id="s4.5.1"> 4.5.1. Overriding objects (externals and native)</A> </H4>

<p>We've seen that Pd loads and sticks to an external binary,
but they can get overridden. For instance, if you create <b>[xfade~]</b>
from ELSE and then load ceammc's binary later (that also has an
<b>[xfade~]</b> object), Pd only knows about <b>[xfade~]</b> from ceammc! It's
been also noted how cyclone and zexy have objects with the same
name. If you first load cyclone's binary and zexy's later, zexy's
objects with the same name (such as <b>[>~]</b>) will override and prevail.

<p>And here's an interesting feature, you can also override internal
objects with externals! Say you have an external called <b>[phasor~]</b>.
If it's a single binary, you can force Pd to find it with slash
declarations. Otherwise, if it's a binary pack, you can load as any
other library and if it has objects with the same name as vanilla's
internals, they get overridden! But Pd still keeps a copy of the old
one and renames it by appending "_aliased", so you can still load the
old "phasor~", for instance, as <b>[phasor~_aliased]</b>. You probably
don't want to mess with overriding internals, but it makes sense if you
provide new versions with more features that are fully backwards compatible.

<H3> <A href="#s4.6" id="s4.6"> 4.6. Search order in Pd for objects and files</A> </H3>

<p>This information has been provided in pieces throughout this section of the Manual. But
now well wrap it up after all the information has been presented.

<p>So, whenever you tell Pd to create an object in its box, this is what happens.

<p><b>First</b> it searches in its object list. This includes all of Pd's internals and
other externals that may have been previously loaded.

<p><b>Second</b> it moves on to unknown objects in possible paths. And if you have
[declare -path] in your patch, the defined path(s) has/have priority respecting
the order they are listed from left to right.

<p><b>Third</b> is time to search the path relative to the patch.

<p><b>Fourth</b> it goes to the user added paths, defined at "Path"
in "Preferences". An order is also respected, from top to bottom.

<p><b>Fifth</b> and last, it searches the "standard paths", which
includes the 'extra' library provided by the Pd Vanilla distribution.
Note you can use <b>[declare -stdpath ./]</b> to force priority to search
this folder!

<p>Regarding files, the search order is the same, only the
first step is ignored.
