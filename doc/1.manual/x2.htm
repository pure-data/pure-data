<H2>Pd Manual chapter 2: Theory of operation</H2>

<P>
<A href="index.htm#s2">back to table of contents</A>
<BR><BR>
</P>

<P>

<P>The purpose of this chapter is to describe Pd's design and how it is
supposed to work. Practical details about how to obtain, install, and run Pd
are described in the <A href="x3.htm">next chapter</A>. Links to more extensive
guides (and to more theoretical information about computer music) can be found
in the <A href="x1.htm">previous chapter</A>.

<H3> <A id="s1">2.1. Overview</A> </H3>

<P>Pd (Pure Data) is a real-time graphical programming environment designed for audio
processing that can be expanded to multimedia processing and more. Pd resembles the
MAX system but is much simpler and more portable. For example, with Peter Brinkmann's
libpd you can have Pure Data as an embeddable audio synthesis library. Additionally,
in its origin, Pd was designed to offer a unique experimental feature not found in MAX,
allowing users to define and access data structures in innovative ways, with the ability
to attach shapes and colors to the data in order to visualize it and/or edit it graphically
(see section <A href="x2.htm#s10">2.10 Data Structures</A> for details.)

<P>Despite its lightweight and portable nature, Pd offers a wide range of external
packages that enhance its capabilities, primarily focusing on audio and control
processing. These include notable extensions like "Ceammc", "Cyclone", "ELSE",
"FFTease", "IEMlib", "Pmpd", "TimbreID", "Zexy" and many more. External libraries that
add graphical processing include Mark Dank's GEM package which expands Pd to be used
for simultaneous computer animation and Zack Lee's "Ofelia" that allows you to use
openFrameworks and the Lua programming language within Pd for creating audiovisual artwork
or multimedia applications such as games. For details on installing and managing packages,
refer to the <A href="x4.htm"> Externals</A> chapter.

<H3> <A id="s1.1">2.1.1. The main window, canvases, and printout</A> </H3>

<P>When you start Pd you'll see a main "Pd" window. When you open a Pd document file
you'll see a separate window that corresponds to it, which is known in Pd as a "canvas",
and also referred to as "patch". The main Pd window which looks like this:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.1.1.png" ALT="pd window">
</P>

<P>At the top, you'll see the menu entries: <b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>Put</b>,
<b>Find</b>, <b>Media</b>, <b>Window</b> and <b>Help</b> (on Macs, this is shown
at a top bar on the screen, and there is an additional first <b>Pd</b> menu entry,
as it's common for all apps in macOS).

<P>On the upper right, there is a "DSP" toggle box, which stands for "Digital Signal
Processing" and turns audio processing on and off globally. When "DSP" is on, Pd is
computing audio samples in realtime for all open patches (whether they are visible
or not). Turning off "DSP" halts the computation and releases any audio devices that
Pure Data is utilizing. You can configure audio devices in the "Audio preferences"
as described in the <A href="x3.htm">next chapter</A>.

<P>The <b>Media menu</b> offers shortcuts to toggle DSP on and off. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd>
(<b>Control</b> key on PCs or <b>Command</b> key on Apple computers plus the '<b>/</b>' key)
to turn audio processing on, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> to turn it off. You can check input RMS
audio level if you select "Test Audio and MIDI" and make other Audio and MIDI tests (read more
about this in <A href="x3.htm#s1.0">3.1. Audio and MIDI</A>).

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.1.2.png" ALT="media menu">
</P>

<P>The lower part of the Pd window is a console area for printout from the output of
boxes in patches and for messages from Pd itself (such as errors). If the Pd window is
focused, the font size for menus and printout can be changed using the 'Font' dialog
entry in the <b>Edit menu</b> as shown below. Make your adjustments if you are having
trouble reading on HiDPI screens.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.1.3.png" ALT="edit menu">
</P>

<P>Pd documents ("patches" or "canvases") have their own main window and any number of
sub-windows. The sub-windows can be opened and closed, but they are always running,
whether you see them or not. When opened, sub-windows show up as a separate canvases.
When you have a patch window focused, you can use the 'Font' dialog entry in the
<b>Edit menu</b> to set the patch's font size, which also applies to its subwindows.
It is useful to increase the font size of patches if you're having trouble reading
them on HiDPI screens. Note that the patch's font size gets saved with the file.

<P>Also in the <b>Edit menu</b>, you can "Zoom In" and "Zoom Out" a patch window.
The Zoom settings is not saved in the patch and a zoomed window can also help with
HiDPI screens.

<P>In the <b>Edit menu</b> you can also clear all messages printed in the Pd window with
the 'Clear Console' entry (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> shortcut). On the
<b>Window menu</b> you find the 'Pd Window' entry (with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
shortcut), which brings the Pd window to the front or sends it behind and brings back to
focus the last focused window.

<P>You can create and open patches via the <b>File menu</b>, where you can also close
and save them (note the handy shortcuts).

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.1.4.png" ALT="file menu">
</P>

<P>On PCs, this menu shows the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> entry to quit Pd, which prompts
you to confirm the action (on Macs, this is listed in the <b>Pd menu</b>). To quit
without confirmation, use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>.

<P>Here is a simple Pd patch:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.1.5.png" ALT="simple patch">
</P>

<P>There are four <I>text boxes</I> in this patch: a number box (showing zero),
an object box showing "print", plus two "comments" (which are simply commentaries
that don't really affect the patch and can't be connected to anything). The number
box is connected to the object box, with the output of the number box feeding into
the input of the [print] object box. Boxes may have zero or more inputs and/or
outputs, with the inputs on top and the outputs on the bottom. When clicking and
dragging on the number box, the values are printed in the main "Pd" window.

<H3> <A id="s1.2">2.1.2. Object boxes</A> </H3>

<P>The object box loads an instance of a class in your patch. You can create an
object box from the <b>Put menu</b>. When you insert a new object box, it is empty
and presented with a dashed border before creation.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.1.6.png" ALT="dashed box">
</P>

<P>You only create a particular <I>object</I> after you entered text into the
object box. The text consists of <I>atoms</I>, which are separated by spaces.
The initial atom (which needs to be a symbol) determines the type of object Pd
will create, while the subsequent atoms, known as <I>creation arguments</I>,
instruct Pd how to initialize the object. For instance, you can type "+ 13".

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.1.7.png" ALT="object box">
</P>

<P>Here, the "+" specifies the <I>class</I> of the object. In this case the
object will carry out additions, and the "13" initializes the value to add.

<P>Atoms are either <I>numbers</I> or <I>symbols</I>. Anything that is not a
valid number (like "+") is considered a symbol. Valid numbers may or may not
have a decimal point, such as "12", "15.6", "-0.456". Numbers may also be written
in exponential notation, such as "4.5e+06", which means "4.5" times "10ˆ6" (10
to power of 6, i.e., 1000000) and results in "4500000". Negative exponentials
also work, such as 1.5e-06, which means "1.5" times "10ˆ-6" and results in
"0.0000015".

<P>Non-valid numbers, which are read as symbols, include things like "+5" and "0..6"
as well as words and names such as "Zack" or "cat". The symbols "gore", "Gore", and
"GORE" are all distinct.

<P>The text you type into an object box determines how many and what kinds of
inlets and outlets the object will have. Certain classes, such as [+], consistently
maintain a fixed configuration of inlets and outlets. However, for other classes,
the number and arrangement of inlets and outlets can vary based on the creation
arguments.

<P>Here is an example of a simple MIDI synthesizer:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.1.8.png" ALT="simple MIDI synthesizer">
</P>

<P>This patch mixes <I>control</I> objects ([notein], [stripnote], and [ftom])
with <I>tilde</I> objects [osc~], [*~], and [dac~] and these are the two types of
objects in Pd. The control objects carry out their function sporadically, as a
result of one or more types of <I>events</I>. In this case, incoming MIDI note
messages set off the control computation. When a note event happens (more
specifically a "note on" event, since "note off" events are filtered by [stripnote]),
the control computation is triggered and it computes the frequency in cycles per
second with [mtof] and passes it on to the oscillator ([osc~]).

<P>The second half of the patch (the [osc~], [*~], and [dac~] objects) computes
audio samples. The [osc~] object is acting as the interface between the two regimes,
in that it takes control messages to set its frequency but outputs an audio sine
wave to a gain level adjustment in [*~], which then goes to the output via [dac~].
The connections in the patch (the lines between the boxes) are also of two types:
control and signal. Note that they are visually distinct, where signal connections
are thicker than control connections. The type of connection depends on the outlet
it comes from; in the patch above, the two bottom connections are signal and the
others are control. A control connection may be made to a signal inlet and if numbers
are sent over it they are usually automatically converted to signals. Signal
connections may not be made to control inlets; some sort of explicit conversion
from audio signal to control data must be specified.

<P>Audio signals form continuous streams of numbers, not intermittent bursts.
Therefore, tilde objects operate under rules distinct from those for control objects.
When DSP is activated, the audio segment of the patch runs constantly, regardless
of whether MIDI messages are received. Conversely, control computations serve to
insert calculations between the audio processing, potentially altering audio
computation parameters like the frequency of an oscillator in this example.

<H3> <A id="s1.3">2.1.3. Message and GUI boxes</A> </H3>

<P>The shape of a box tells you how its text is interpreted and how the box
functions. Object boxes (as in the previous example) are rectangular and use
the text to create objects when you load a patch or type text onto a new one.
That is, the contents of an object box describe a message which is sent to Pd
to create the object. If you retype the text in an object box, the old one is
discarded and a new one is created, using the new creation arguments.

<P><I>Message</I> boxes have a different shape and interpret the text as a
message to send whenever the box is activated (through an incoming message or via
a mouse click). The message may be sent many times while the patch is running
(as opposed to object boxes whose message is used once to create the object).
Instead of going straight to Pd, the message box's message (or messages) go either
to its outlet or to other specified receiving objects. In the example below,
a click on the message box sends the message "21" to an object box, which adds 13
to it.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.1.9.png" ALT="[message( --> [object] -> [number]">
</P>

<P>The third box here is a <I>GUI</I> ("graphical user interface") box. Pd has
three basic GUI boxes. In addition to number boxes (as in this example), there are
boxes to display and edit symbols or arbitrary lists of atoms. Pd also comes with
another set GUIs that include toggles, sliders, radio buttons and so on.

<P>You can interact with GUIs in many ways and they are visually dynamic. For instance,
while the appearance of an object or message box remains unchanged when a patch is running,
a number box's content (the text) changes to reflect the current value held by the box.
You can also use a number box as a control by clicking and dragging up and down, or
by typing values in it and hitting enter (more details on how this and any other GUIs
work is available in the help files; see <A href="x2.htm#s2.7">Context menu for
'Properties', 'Open' and 'Help'</A> to find out how to look this up).

<H3> <A id="s1.4">2.1.4. Patches and files</A> </H3>

<P>As mentioned before, You can create or open a Pd file from the <b>File menu</b>,
as well as close and save them.

<P>When you save a patch to a file, Pd doesn't save the entire state of all the
objects in the patch, but only what you see: the objects' creation arguments
and their interconnections. Nonetheless, the [savestate] object offers a mechanism
to save the state of abstractions (see <A href="x2.htm#s8">Subpatches</A>). Also,
certain data-storage objects have functions for reading and writing other files to
save and restore their internal state (one example is the [text] object). When loading
a patch, the [loadbang] object can be used to initialize the parameters of your patch,
so you can load text files and make other preparations.

<P>Pd finds files using specified <I>paths</I>. Most objects which can read files
search for them along the search paths, but when Pd writes files they go to the
directory where the patch was found.

<H3> <A id="s2">2.2. Editing Pd patches</A> </H3>

<P>Normally, you'll use Pd in run mode, which is also referred to as "performance
mode". In order to edit a patch, you need to go into edit mode.

<H3> <A id="s2.1">2.2.1. Edit and Run mode</A> </H3>

<P>When you open a Pd file, it is in run mode. In run mode, the cursor is an arrow that
points up and is slightly tilted to the left, but it points straight up when you are
able to click on a box. In run mode, you mostly click and interact with GUIs (like the
number box) and message boxes (which are used as controls to send messages).

<P> In order to go into edit mode, you need to select the 'Edit Mode' entry from the
<b>Edit menu</b> to activate and check it on.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.2.1.png" ALT="edit mode">
</P>

<P>When you are in edit mode, the patch actually runs in the same way as in run mode,
processing control data and sound, but you're able to edit the patch while it runs.
The only real change is how mouse clicks affect the patch. In run mode, mouse clicks
will interact with the patch and change parameters of the performance, while in edit
mode the purpose of mouse clicks is to edit and change the patch. Note that in edit
mode, the mouse cursor becomes a pointing hand instead of an arrow. Unchecking the
"Edit Mode" entry returns the patch to run mode and changes the cursor back to an
arrow. You can use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> shortcut to switch between these modes.

<P>In edit mode, you can move boxes around by clicking on them and dragging.
You can also edit text, create or delete boxes and make or cut connections.
More details follow below.

<P>If you are predominantly editing a patch, but would like to quickly switch to
run mode just to click on something like a message, you can press and hold the
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to temporarily switch to edit mode until you release it.

<P>In the <b>Edit menu</b> you also find "Undo" and "Redo" operations, which revert
and recreate changes you've done in your patch while in edit mode. Note that you can
also "Undo" and "Redo" while in run mode.

<H3> <A id="s2.2">2.2.2. Creating boxes</A> </H3>

<P>Pd patches can have four types of boxes: <I>object, message, GUI</I> and
<I>comment</I> (which counts as a "box type" even thought it's not a proper
'box' visually). You can create these boxes using the <b>Put menu</b>. Also
note the handy shortcuts to create each item specifically.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.2.2.png" ALT="put menu">
</P>

<P> Note that most of these are individual GUI (graphical user interface) boxes.
Besides the three basic GUI boxes (number, symbol andlists), there's another group
of GUIs that more options (toggles, sliders, radio buttons, etc). These other GUIs
are also known as "IEMguis", which used to be an external library package and was
incorporated natively into Pd in version 0.34 (they can still be created from
object boxes though - see their help patches for the corresponding symbols). There
are also entries for "array" and "graph" that will be explained later.


<P>If you are in run mode and click on an entry on the <b>Put menu</b> or use
a shortcut, Pd automatically switches to edit mode. When you create boxes
this way, they are automatically selected and follow the mouse cursor position;
drag them around as desired until you click to position them where you want.
This keeps the box selected and you can deselect it by clicking on an empty spot
of the patch or using the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.

<P>Message and object boxes are empty when created. After being positioned you
starting to type into them. Also, start to typing into them will force position
them if they haven't been positioned yet by a click. Deselecting the object box
after you typed the object name creates it.

<P>When you create a comment box, it shows a "comment" symbol. When you position
it, this symbol is selected, so you can start typing a new commentary.

<P>You may find it more convenient to select a box and "duplicate" it than to use
the <b>Put menu</b>. If you duplicate a selection of several items, any connections
between them will be duplicated as well. To deselect more than one box, you
can also either click on an empty area of your patch or press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

<H3> <A id="s2.3">2.2.3. Selecting items and moving them or "tidying them up"</A> </H3>

<P>In Edit mode you can select or deselect one or more boxes. Note that the outline
of all boxes and containing text turn light blue (instead of the usual black) to
indicate they are selected. Boxes in a Pd window may be individually selected by
clicking on them. If you don't release the mouse button you can select a box and drag
it around right away.

<P>To select more than one box, you may use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on each item.
You can then click again on one of the selected boxes to move the group around.
Alternatively, you click on a blank portion of the window and drag the cursor to
select all boxes within a rectangular area (then click again on one of the selected
boxes to move them as well). If you press <kbd>Shift</kbd>, you can repeat the click
and drag operation to select another group of boxes as well. If you do <kbd>Shift</kbd>
+<kbd>Click</kbd> on a selected box, you deselect it. The "Select All" entry on the <b>Edit
menu</b> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>) selects all items in a patch window.

<P>When you have one or more boxes selected, you can also move them by using the
<kbd>Arrow keys</kbd>, which moves items one pixel in the direction of the arrows.
You can also use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> to move items 10 pixels in the
desired direction. By the way, if you select boxes that are connected, the
connections (patch cords) are also moved around.

<P>The 'Tidy Up' entry in the <b>Edit menu</b> allows you to try and align
selected boxes that are not perfectly aligned. You can select boxes arranged in a
horizontal row and use the shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to try and
align them perfectly horizontally. Similarly, this can be applied to vertically
align a column of boxes. Bidimensional rectangular selections of boxes are also
possible, but aligning horizontally and vertically separately tends to yield
better results.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.2.3.png" ALT="tidy up">
</P>

<H3> <A id="s2.4">2.2.4. Delete, cut, copy and paste boxes</A> </H3>

<P>If you select any item you can press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd>
key to delete it. Connections of a deleted box are also deleted. A multiple selection
of items (and their connections) can also be deleted.

<P>For one or more selected items and their connections you can also "cut", "copy",
"paste" and "duplicate" "from the <b>Edit menu</b> or shortcuts. Notice you can
"cut" or "copy" and then "paste" the selection in a different window. When pasted,
the items stay selected, so you can click on one of the selected items and move the
whole group around by dragging.

<P>Note that pasting inserts the selection at the same position it was copied,
unless the place is already taken, when there is a small offeset. The "duplicate"
menu item performs a copy and paste with a small offset (since the original
selection remains in the original position). You can then click on an item in
the duplicated selection and drag them all together to a new spot in the patch
window away from the original selection.

<P>While you can cut or copy a selection within a patch and paste it into a
different window within Pure Data, the cut/paste functionality for patch elements
is not integrated with the operating system clipboard. This limitation means you
cannot paste between different versions or flavors of Pure Data. Additionally,
it is not possible to copy from a patch and paste into a Pd subprocess instantiated
via a [pd~] object.

<H3> <A id="s2.5">2.2.5. Changing the text</A> </H3>

<P>Clicking on an unselected object, message or comment box and releasing the
click makes the text active, i.e., ready to be text edited (if you select using
a rectangular area selection or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd>, the text isn't activated).

<P>If you only click once, the entire text is selected and your typing will replace
the whole selections. Use <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> to navigate the cursor through the
text or use the mouse to click and drag to change the text selection and edit it.

<P>If you wish to displace a box whose text is activated you need to first deselect
it (by clicking outside it or using <kbd>Esc</kbd>), otherwise you will be selecting
text instead of moving the box.

<P><I>The updated text only becomes part of the patch when you deselect the
object.</I> As already mentioned, changing the text in an object box deletes
the old object and creates a new one; so the internal state of the old one is
completely lost.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.2.4.png" ALT="changing text">
</P>

<P>You can also use the copy, cut, and paste commands for the selected text. The
text selection functionality for cut/copy/paste is integrated with the operating
system, enabling you to copy and paste text between Pd and other software
applications.

<H3> <A id="s2.6">2.2.6. Connecting and disconnecting boxes</A> </H3>

<P>This subsection only describes the simplest way to connect two boxes. For
more advanced and convenient techniques and shortcuts, refer to the next section.

<P>To create a connection in edit mode, move your mouse into the the area of
an outlet. Note that the cursor becomes a circle (a patch point), indicating
that you can click and drag to create a connection. Drag the cord into an inlet
area, where you'll see again the circle shaped cursor, signaling that you can
release the mouse button to create a connection. You can release the mouse button
anywhere within the target box and the connection will be made to the nearest
inlet.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.2.5.png" ALT="connecting boxes">
</P>

<P>If you move the mouse cursor over a patch cord, you'll see it takes the shape
of an "X" to denote you can select it and delete it. Click on the connection
to select it and press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> key to delete
it. You can't just select patch cords with click and drag for a rectangular
area and you can only select a single connection by clicking on it.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.2.6.png" ALT="disconnecting boxes">
</P>

<H3> <A id="s2.7">2.2.7. Context menu for 'Properties', 'Open' and 'Help'</A> </H3>

<P>All the "clicking" mentioned above is done with the left mouse button.
The right button, instead, opens a context menu offering "Properties",
"Open" and "Help" (either in edit or run mode). Apple users, who may only
have one button should know that <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> is mapped
to right-click and that new magic mouse devices can map gestures when you
click with two fingers (same is true for trackpads).

<P>Selecting "Help" on any box opens a patch explaining and demonstrating
what it is and how it works. Asking "Help" for the canvas as a whole
(right-clicking outside any box) gives a list of all built-in boxes and
every object class.

<P>The "Open" menu item is only enabled if you right-click on a subpatch
(see <A href="x2.htm#s8">Subpatches</A>) and prompts Pd to open it.
Ordinary subpatches may also be opened by simply clicking on them, but for
"graph-on-parent" subpatches, this is the only method available.

<P>The "Properties" dialog allows you to change certain settings of GUI
boxes or of the patch itself (when clicking outside any box).

<H3> <A id="s3">2.3. Advanced patch editing</A> </H3>

<P>This section describes advanced techniques and shortcuts for editing patches.

<H3> <A id="s3.1">2.3.1. Tab navigation</A> </H3>

<P>When a single box is selected, pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> allows you to
navigate and change the selection to other boxes in the sequence determined
by the order of their creation. Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> cycles through the
boxes from the earliest created to the next, and upon reaching the last box
in the window the selection loops back to the first one. Conversely, you can
press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate in reverse order, moving from the
most recently created box back towards the first created ones.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.3.1.png" ALT="tab navigation boxes">
</P>

<P>Using <kbd>Tab</kbd> also works in a similar way for patch cords if
you have one selected. You can move from first to last with <kbd>Tab</kbd>
and from last to first with <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.3.2.png" ALT="tab navigation cords">
</P>

<P>If you're creating a connection by clicking on an outlet and dragging a
patch cord, you can also use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to cycle through outlets.
The navigation order is left to right and it also cycles back. Pressing
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> navigates from right to left.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.3.3.png" ALT="tab navigation iolets">
</P>

<P>In Linux and Windows you can also cycle between inlets. This is currently
not possible on macOS. When dragging a connection into an inlet area, without
releasing the mouse, you can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate to the next inlet,
or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate to the previous one.

<H3> <A id="s3.2">2.3.2. Autopatching</A> </H3>

<P>By default, Pd has an 'autopatching' mode set to on. You can disable it
via startup flags (see '-autopatch' flag <a href="x3.htm#s4">Preferences
and startup options</A>). This works with the shortcuts from the <b>Put
menu</b> for inserting boxes. If you have a selected box and use a shortcut
to create another one (such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> to create an object box),
the created box is placed below the selected box and a connection is made
from the first outlet of the selected box into the inlet of the newly created
box (granted that these boxes have an outlet and an inlet for the connection
to happen).

<P>Once the new box is created, it is also selected, so you can continue with
autopatching by adding yet more boxes. In the case of object and message boxes
you can also start typing text into it before autopatching into another newly
created box, since when you autopatch for the next one, the object or message
box gets deselected and therefore created.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.3.4.png" ALT="autopatch objects">

<P>You can also autopatch into a newly created subpatch (see <A href="x2.htm#s8">

inlet ([inlet]) if the object above is a control object, or a signal inlet

<P>The 'Triggerize' entry in the <b>Edit menu</b> with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>
shortcut was designed to insert a [trigger] object (in its abbreviated form [t]).
When you select a single box that is connected to many inlets of a single or
multiple boxes use "Triggerize" to insert this object, which is briefly described
in <A href="x2.htm#s4.3">Hot and cold inlets and right to left outlet order</A>.

<P>The [trigger] object is widely used in Pd to control the order of execution
from right to left. 'Triggerize' then creates the [trigger] object taking into
account the order in which the connections were made, where the first connection
starts at the rightmost outlet of [trigger] and continues to the leftmost.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.3.19.png" ALT="triggerize object">

<P>Additionally, the 'Triggerize' option can be used to insert a dummy object.
To do so, select a connection and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>. For a control
connection, a [t a] object is created with the text selected, so you
can type another text to include another object instead. For a signal
connection, a [pd nop~] subpatch is created, also with the text selected
for you to replace for a new object.

<P>While the connections of a [trigger] object can be resorted as
<A href="x2.htm#s3.4">explained above</A>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> also
allows you to easily manage its outlets when using it on the selected object.
The result will differ depending on the existing connections and outlets.
If each outlet has a single connection, it will insert an outlet on the left.

<P>The 'Paste Replace' entry in the <b>Edit menu</b> doesn't have a

of boxes for another kind. For example, first copy one box such as a
[float] object. Then select a group of boxes of the same type, for
instance, a group of object boxes (note that they don't need to be
of the same class). Now go to the <b>Edit menu</b> and select "Paste Replace".
All the selected boxes of the same type get replaced by the copied box

<P>Alternatively, you can copy a number box instead of a [float] object
and replace it in the selected group of objects, or in a selected group
of another kind, such as message boxes. Note that the box types in Pd
are: objects, messages, GUIs and comments, whereas 'IEMguis' are actually
treated in this case as regular object boxes. Hence, the GUI boxes are
only the number box, the symbol box and the list box. Also note that
these three GUIs are not of the same kind for the purpose of "Paste Replace".
A subpatch or an abstraction can also be used for "Paste Replace" and they
count in the same group of objects.

<H3> <A id="s4">2.4. Messages</A> </H3>

<P>In Pd, boxes intercommunicate by sending messages and/or audio signals.
Pd messages are sporadic, like MIDI messages or Music N "Note cards".

<H3> <A id="s4.1">2.4.1. Anatomy of a message</A> </H3>

<P>Messages contain a selector followed by any number of arguments. The selector
is a symbol, which appears in the patch as a non-numeric string with no white
space, semicolons, or commas. The arguments may be symbols or numbers.

<P>Pd is usually compiled for single precision, but you can compile it for
double precision as well (see <A href="x6.htm#s6.6">Double precision</A>).
If compiled for single precision, numbers are kept in 32-bit floating point,
while if compiled for double precision (AKA: "Pd64") you have values in
64-bit floating point precision. The integer values you can represent in
each case is shown on the table below. (In Max, there are separate data
types for integers and floating point numbers; Pd uses only float.)

<P>When a message is passed to something (which is often an inlet of a box
but could be anything that can receive a message), the selector of the message
is checked against the receiver. If the receiver recognizes messages of that
selector, it carries out some corresponding action. For instance, here is a
[float] object:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.1.png" ALT="float object">
</P>

<P>The two rectangles at the top are usually both called "inlets", but the
one on the left directs incoming messages to the [float] object itself, while
the one on the right directs messages to an auxiliary "inlet" object. The
[float] object itself (represented by the left inlet) accepts messages with
the selectors "float" and "bang". The right inlet only accepts messages with
the "float" selector. These two selectors, together with "symbol" and "list",
are usually used to indicate the main action of an object, whatever it may be,
so that objects can be linked together with maximum flexibility.

<P>Numbers cannot be used as a selectors. A message single number is always given
the "float" selector automatically, and a message with a number followed by other
arguments is given the selector "list".

<H3> <A id="s4.2">2.4.2. Depth first message passing</A> </H3>

<P>Whenever a message is initiated in Pd, the receiver may then send out
further messages in turn, and the receivers of those messages can send yet
others. So each message sets off a tree of consequent messages. This tree is
executed in depth first fashion. For instance in the patch below:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.2.png" ALT="depth first">
</P>

<P>the order of arrival of messages is either A-B-C-D or A-C-D-B. The "C"
message is not done until the "D" one is also, and the "A" is not done until
all four are. It is not visible whether "B" or "C" is done first; this
depends on the order the connections were made in (in Max, it's automatically
sorted right to left).

<P>Message-passing can give rise to infinite loops of the sort shown here:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.3.png" ALT="infinite loop">
</P>

<P>Here, the left-hand [+ 1] can't finish processing until the right-hand one has
been sent the result "2", which can't finish processing until the
left-hand one has been sent "3", and so on. Pd will print an error message
reporting a "stack overflow" if this happens.

<P>However, it is legal to make a loop if there is a [delay] object somewhere
in it. When [delay] receives a message, it schedules a message for the
future (even if the time delay is 0) and is then "finished"; Pd's internal
scheduler will wake the delay back up later.

<H3> <A id="s4.3">2.4.3. Hot and cold inlets and right to left outlet order</A> </H3>

<P>With few exceptions (notably [timer]), objects treat their leftmost
inlet as "hot" in the sense that messages to left inlets can result in output
messages. So the following is a legal (and reasonable) loop construct:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.4.png" ALT="hot and cold inlets">
</P>

<P>Here, the [f] object is an abbreviation for [float]. Note that the [+ 1] output
is connected to the right-hand inlet of [f]. This "cold" inlet merely stores the
value for the next time the [f] is sent the "bang" message.

<P>It is frequently desirable to send messages to two or more inlets of an object
to specify its action. For instance, you can use [+] to add two numbers; but
to do it correctly you must make sure the right hand inlet gets its value
first. Otherwise, when the left hand side value comes in, [+] will carry out
the addition (since the left hand inlet is the "hot" one) and will add this
value to whatever was previously sitting in the right hand inlet.

<P>Problems can arise when a single outlet is connected (either directly or
through arbitrarily long chains of message passing) to different inlets of a
single object. In this case it is indeterminate which order the two inlets will
receive their messages. Suppose for example you wish to use [+] to double a
number. The following is incorrect:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.5.png" ALT="incorrect inlet connection">
</P>

<P>Here, the left inlet was connected before connecting the right hand one
(although this is not evident in the appearance of the patch). The [+] thus
adds the new input (at left) to the previous input (at right).

<P>The [trigger] object, abbreviated [t], can be used to split out connections
from a single outlet in a determinate order. By convention, all objects in Pd,
when sending messages out more than one outlet, do so from right to left. If
you connect these to inlets of a second object without crossing wires, the
second object will get its leftmost inlet last, which is usually what you
want. Here is how to use [trigger] to disambiguate the previous example:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.6.png" ALT="trigger to disambiguate">
</P>

<P>"Cold" (non-leftmost) inlets are almost universally used to store single
values (either numbers or symbols). With the exception of [line], [line~]
and [vline~], these values are "sticky", i.e., once you set the value it is
good until the next time you set it. (The "line family" exception is for
sanity's sake.)

<P>One more question sometimes comes up concerning execution order when two
messages are sent to a single "cold" inlet. In this situation, since the messages
are merged, the last value to be received is the value that is used for the next
computation.

<H3> <A id="s4.4">2.4.4. Message boxes</A> </H3>

<p>Message boxes are text boxes in which you type a message. When the message
box is activated, either by clicking on it or by sending something to its inlet,
the message or messages are sent, either to the message box's outlet or
elsewhere as specified.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.7.png" ALT="message boxes">
</P>

<P>The first of the message boxes above contains the single number 1.5; this
message has an implicit selector of "float". The second is a list with three
numbers in it, and in the third, the selector is "my" and the two arguments are
the number 5 and the symbol "toes".

<P>Multiple messages may be separated by commas as shown:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.8.png" ALT="multiple messages in one box">
</P>

<P>Here, the three messages are the numbers 1, 2, and 3, and they are sent in
sequence (with no intervening time between them, as with the [trigger] object,
and having depth-first consequences so that whatever chain of actions depending
on "1" takes place before anything depending on "2" and so on).

<P>Semicolons may also separate messages. A message following a semicolon must
specify a symbol giving a destination (in other words, semicolons are like commas
except that they clear the "current destination" so that the next message
specifies a new one). The "current destination" is at first the message box's own
outlet. In the example below, the leading semicolon immediately redirects messages
from the outlet to an object named "fred" (which is a receive object here), and
likewise the next message is sent to "sue".

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.9.png" ALT="semicolons to send messages">
</P>

<P>Certain other objects (Pd windows for example, and arrays) have Pd names as
destination symbols so you can send them messages this way. Also, the special
receiver "pd" is defined to which you may send messages to start and stop DSP and
more.

<P>You can put variables in message boxes as shown below:

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.4.10.png" ALT="variables in message boxes">
</P>

<P>Here, "$1" etc., refer to the arguments of the arriving message (and aren't
defined if you send a "bang" message or if you click on the message box to
activate it). Dollar sign variables are either numbers or symbols depending
on the incoming message; if they are symbols, you may even use them to specify
variable message selectors or destinations.

<H3> <A id="s5">2.5. Audio signals</A> </H3>

<P>Using Pd, you can build audio patches which can synthesize musical sounds,
analyze incoming sounds, process incoming sounds to produce transformed
audio outputs, or integrate audio processing with other media. This section
describes how Pd treats audio signals.

<H3> <A id="s5.1">2.5.1. Sample rate and format</A> </H3>

<P>Pd's audio signals are internally kept as 32-bit floating point numbers, so
you have all the dynamic range you could want. However, depending on your
hardware, audio I/O is usually limited to 16 or 24 bits. Inputs all appear
between the values of -1 and 1; and output values will be clipped to that range.
Pd assumes a sample rate of 44100 unless you override this (in Pd's command line
or in the "audio setup" dialog).

<P>Pd can read or write samples to files either in 16-bit or 24-bit fixed point
or in 32-bit floating point, in 'wave', 'aiff', 'caf', and 'next' formats via
the [soundfiler], [readsf~], and [writesf~] objects.

<H3> <A id="s5.2">2.5.2. Tilde objects and audio connections</A> </H3>

<P>Audio computations in Pd are carried out by "tilde objects" such as [osc~],
whose names conventionally end with a tilde character (which resembles a sinusoid,
symbolizing their function in handling audio signals). Tilde objects can
intercommunicate via audio connections. When audio computation is turned on or
when you change the audio network while audio is on, Pd sorts all the tilde objects
into a linear order for running; this linear list is then by default run down in
blocks of 64 samples each at 44100 Hz. this means the audio network runs every
1.45 milliseconds.

<P>Inlets or outlets are configured in Pd either for messages or audio. You can't
connect an audio outlet to a non-audio inlet. An object's leftmost inlet may accept
both audio and messages; any other inlet is either one or the other, but secondary
audio inlets take floats at control rate and promote them automatically to signals.
Nonetheless, in some cases, the inlet may take both a float or a sinal and run
different algorithms in each case. One example is [lop~], which runs a more
efficient routine if no signals are connected to the right inlet. The [+~], [-~],
[*~], [/~]. [max~], [min~], [log~] and [pow~] objects can be configured to take
control or signal inputs in their 2nd inlet depending on the creation argument.

<P>The audio network, that is, the tilde objects and their interconnections,
must be non-cyclic. If there are loops at "sort time", you will see an error
message on the main Pd window, saying <b>"DSP loop detected (some tilde
objects weren't scheduled)"</b>. You can build algorithms with feedback using
nonlocal signal connections as explained in the <A href="x2.htm#s5.5">2.5.5.
subsection</A>.

<P>Your subpatches can have audio inlets and outlets via the [inlet~] and [outlet~]
objects (see <A href="x2.htm#s8">Subpatches</A>).

<H3> <A id="s5.3">2.5.3. Converting audio to and from messages</A> </H3>

<P>If you want to use a control value as a signal, you can use the [sig~]
object to convert it. This is usually rare since objects mostly promote
floats to signals as mentioned. At least this is true for all native objects
in Pd, but there are externals that can behave differently. The [sig~] object
is also useful for loading a default signal value with its creation argument.
You can also use [line~] and [vline~] to "convert" from control to signal with
a smoothen ramp, so to speak, which can be quite useful.

<P>The other direction, signal to control, requires that you specify at what
moments you want the signal sampled. This is handled by the [snapshot~] object,
but you can also sample a signal with [tabwrite~] and then access it via
[tabread] or [tabread4] (note the missing tildes!) There are also analysis
objects, the simplest of which is [env~], the envelope follower, that outputs
control rate floats.

<H3> <A id="s5.4">2.5.4. Switching and blocking</A> </H3>

<P>You can use the [switch~] or [block~] objects to turn portions of your audio
computation on and off and to control the block size of computation. There may
be only one [switch~] or [block~] object per window; it acts on the entire
window and all of its subwindows (which may still have their own nested
[switch~]/[block~] objects though). Both, [switch~] and [block~] take a block
size and optional overlap and up-/downsampling factors as arguments; so for
instance, [block~ 1024 4] specifies 1024 sample blocks, overlapped by a factor
of 4 relative to the parent window. The [switch~] version carries a small
computational overhead in addition to whatever overhead is associated with
changing the block size.

<P>Larger block sizes than 64 should result in a small increase of runtime
efficiency. Also, the [fft~] and related objects operate on blocks so that
setting the block size also sets the number of FFT channels. You may wish
to use block sizes smaller than 64 to gain finer resolutions of message/audio
interaction, or to reduce "block delay" in feedback algorithms. At the extreme,
setting the block size to 1 allows you to write your own recursive filters or
other DSP algorithms that require a 1-sample-feedback.

<P>You can use [switch~] to budget your DSP computations. For instance you might
want to be able to switch between two synthesis algorithms. To do this, put
each algorithm in its own subpatch (which can have sub-subpatches in turn, for
a voice bank for instance), and switch each one off as you switch the other one
on. Beware of clicks; if you have a [line~] controlling output level, give it
time to ramp to zero before you switch it off or it will be stuck at a non-zero
value for the next time it comes back on.

<P>When a subpatch is switched off, its audio outputs generate zeros, which
costs a fairly small overhead. A cheaper way to get outputs is to use [throw~]
inside the switched module and [catch~] outside it.

<H3> <A id="s5.5">2.5.5. Nonlocal signal connections</A> </H3>

<P>You may wish to pass signals non-locally, either to get from one window to
another, or to feed a signal back to your algorithm's input. This can be done
using [throw~]/[catch~], [send~]/[receive~], or [delwrite~]/[delread~] or
[delread4~] pairs. Both, [throw~] and [catch~] implement a summing bus; [throw~]
adds into the bus and [catch~] reads out the accumulated signal and zeros the
bus for the next time around. There can be many [throw~] objects associated with
a single [catch~], but a [throw~] can't talk to more than one [catch~]. You can
reset the destination of a [throw~] if you want to.

<P>On the other hand, [send~] just saves a signal which may then be received
by a [receive~] object any number of times; but a [receive~] can only pick up
one [send~] at a time (you can switch between [send~] objects if you want though).

<P>Don't try to [throw~] and [catch~] or [send~] and [receive~] between windows
with different block sizes. The only well tested re-blocking mechanisms are
[inlet~] and [outlet~].

<P>When you send a signal to a point that is earlier in the sorted list of
tilde objects, the signal doesn't get there until the next cycle of DSP
computation (one block later), so your signal will be delayed by one block
(1.45 msec by default). The [delwrite~] and [delread~]/[delread4~] have this
same restriction, but here, the 1.45 msec are minimum attainable delay.

<H3> <A id="s5.6">2.5.6. Multichannel signals</A> </H3>

<P>As of Pd version 0.54-0, signals may be multichannel. Every signal has a
<i>length</i> equal to the window's block size (64 by default), and also has a
<i>channel count</i> which is 1 by default. The [snake~] object can combine
any number of single-channel signals into a multichannel one, or alternatively
can split a multichannel signal into its component single-channel ones.
Non-local connections ([send~], [receive~], [throw~], [catch~], [inlet~] and
[outlet~]) can be used to pass multichannel signals from window to window, and
[dac~] and [adc~] can input and output several inputs or outputs into, or out of
one multichannel signal.

<P>The [receive~], [catch~], and [adc~] objects take arguments to specify the
desired number of channels.

<P>Stateless objects, which have no memory from one DSP tick to the next, have
all been adapted to handle multichannel inputs and outputs. The arithmetic and
math objects ([+~], [-~], [*~], [/~], [wrap~], [sqrt~] and so on) use their
inputs to determine their channel counts. Binary operations like [+~] can combine
single- and multichannel inputs.

<P>Other objects, such as filters or oscillators, have not been adapted for
multichannel signals, because there might be many ways to design multichannel
versions of them. Instead, you can use the [clone] object to perform general
operations on multichannel signals. Signal inputs and outputs of cloned patches
can be used to distribute multichannel signals among the individual cloned
patches.

<H3> <A id="s6">2.6. Scheduling</A> </H3>

<P>Pd uses 64-bit floating point numbers to represent time, providing sample
accuracy and essentially never overflowing. Time appears to the user
in milliseconds.

<H3> <A id="s6.1">2.6.1. Audio and messages</A> </H3>

<P>Audio and message processing are interleaved in Pd. Audio processing
is scheduled every block (64 samples by default) at Pd's sample rate, which
is 44100 Hz by default and results in a period of approximately 1.45
milliseconds. You may turn DSP computation on and off in a patch by sending
the messages "dsp 1" and "dsp 0" to "pd".

<P>
    <IMG src="img/2.6.1.png" ALT="dsp on and off on patch level">
</P>

<P>In the intervals between, delays might time out or external conditions
might arise (incoming MIDI, mouse clicks or whatnot). These may cause a
cascade of depth-first message passing; each such message cascade is completely
run out before the next message or DSP tick is computed. Messages are never
passed to objects during a DSP tick; the ticks are atomic and parameter changes
sent to different objects in any given message cascade take effect
simultaneously.

<P>In the middle of a message cascade, you may schedule another one at a delay
of zero. This delayed cascade happens after the present cascade has finished,
but at the same logical time.

<H3> <A id="s6.2">2.6.2. Computation load</A> </H3>

<P>The Pd scheduler maintains a (user-specified) lead on its computations;
that is, it tries to keep ahead of real time by a small amount in order to be
able to absorb unpredictable, momentary increases in computation time. This
is specified using the "-audiobuf" and "-blocksize" command line flags
(see <a href="x3.htm">Getting Pd to run</A>).

<P>If Pd gets late with respect to real time, gaps (either occasional or
frequent) will appear in both the input and output audio streams. On the
other hand, disk streaming objects will work correctly, so that you may use
Pd as a batch program with soundfile input and/or output. The "-nogui"
and "-send" startup flags are provided to aid in doing this.

<P>Pd's "realtime" computations compete for CPU time with its own GUI, which
runs as a separate process. A flow control mechanism will be provided someday
to prevent this from causing trouble, but it is in any case wise to avoid
having too much drawing going on while Pd is trying to make sound. If a
sub-window is closed, Pd suspends sending the GUI update messages for it;
but not so for minimized windows as of version 0.32 - you should really
close them when you aren't using them.

<H3> <A id="s6.3">2.6.3. Determinism</A> </H3>

<P>All message cascades that are scheduled (via [delay] and its relatives) to
happen before a given audio tick will happen as scheduled, regardless of whether
Pd as a whole is running on time; in other words, calculation is never reordered
for any real-time considerations. This is done in order to make Pd's operation
deterministic.

<P>If a message cascade is started by an external event, a time tag is given
to it. These time tags are guaranteed to be consistent with the times at which
timeouts are scheduled and DSP ticks are computed; i.e., time never decreases.
(However, either Pd or a hardware driver may lie about the physical time an
input arrives; this depends on the operating system.) "Timer" objects which
measure time intervals, measure them in terms of the logical time stamps of the
message cascades, so that timing a [delay] object always gives exactly the
theoretical value. (There is, however, a [realtime] object that measures real
time, with nondeterministic results.)

<P>If two message cascades are scheduled for the same logical time, they are
carried out in the order they were scheduled.

<H3> <A id="s7">2.7. Semantics</A> </H3>

<p>This section describes how objects in Pd are created, how they store data
and how object and other boxes pass messages among themselves.

<H3> <A id="s7.1">2.7.1. Creation of objects</A> </H3>

<p>The text in a box has a different function depending on whether it is a message,
atom (number/symbol), or object box. In message boxes, the text specifies the
message or messages it will send as output. In atom boxes, the text changes
at run time to show the state of the box, which is either a number or a symbol.

<P>In an object box, as in a message box, the text specifies a message; but
here, the message is to be passed to Pd itself, once, and the message's effect
is to create the object in question. When you open a file, all the objects
created are created using their text as "creation messages". If you type a new
message into an object box (or change it), the old object is destroyed and the
message is used to create the new one.

<P>The selector of the message (the first word in the message) is a selector
which Pd interprets to determine the type of object to create. Any message
arguments (called "creation arguments") are used to parametrize the object
being created. Thus, in [makenote 64 250] the selector "makenote" determines
the class of object to create and the creation arguments "64" and "250" become
the initial velocity and duration.

<H3> <A id="s7.2">2.7.2. Persistence of data</A> </H3>

<p>Among the design principles of Pd is that patches should be printable, in the
sense that the appearance of a patch should fully determine its functionality.
For this reason, if messages received by an object change its action, since the
changes aren't reflected in the object's appearance, they are not saved as part
of the file which specifies the patch and will be forgotten when the patch is
reloaded. In the same way, if you delete and then recreate an object the
original object's state is not retained but is instead reinitialized (possibly
as specified by creation arguments).

<P>An exception is made for subpatches whose "state" is the configuration of
the subpatch; as a special case, this configuration is restored when the
patch is read from a file. Also, if you rename the subpatch, for instance
typing "pd jane" instead of "pd spot", the contents of the patch are preserved
and only the text in the object box and the window title of the subpatch are
changed.

<P>It is probably bad style to specify creation arguments ala [makenote 64 250]
if you are going to override them later; this is confusing to anyone who tries
to understand the patch.

<H3> <A id="s7.3">2.7.3. Message passing</A> </H3>

<p>Messages in Pd consist of a selector (a symbol) and zero or more arguments
(which may be symbols or numbers). To pass a message to an object, Pd first
checks the selector against the class of the object. Message boxes all are
of one class and they all take the same incoming messages and dispense them
according to their state, that is, the text typed into the box. The same
holds for atom boxes (number or symbol) except that their state may change
(it consists of the number or symbol showing).

<P>Object boxes may have many different classes. The class is usually
determined by the selector of the creation message, i.e., the first atom of the
creation message which is usually a symbol.

<P>Each class comes with a fixed collection of messages it may be sent. For
example, the [float] or [f] object takes "bang" and "float". These messages
are sent to [float] objects (objects whose class is float) via the leftmost,
hot inlet (the right inlet is a separate, auxiliary object). Objects of
class "float" respond to the message "bang" by outputting their current value,
that is, by sending a "float" message to their outlet. They respond to "float"
messages by setting their value and then outputting it.

<P>Each other class (like [float]) in Pd has its own protocol for responding
to messages it is sent, and may take "float" and "bang" messages, or others
in addition or instead of them.

<H3> <A id="s7.4">2.7.4. Inlets and lists</A> </H3>

<P>The leftmost connection point at the top of most objects represents the
object itself. Any other dark rectangle is a separate object called an "inlet",
although there are 4 different inlet classes in Pd. The class of the inlet
determines the type of message it will accept: symbol, float or other; and the
inlet passes the message either to the object itself or to a proxy, usually
one created by the object for the occasion.

<P>Unless they are specified otherwise by defining a "list" method, objects
respond to the "list" message by distributing the arguments of the message to
their inlets, except for the first argument, which is passed to the main object
as a "float" or "symbol" message.

<H3> <A id="s7.5">2.7.5. Dollar signs</A> </H3>

<p>In message or object boxes, message arguments starting with a dollar sign
and a number (like "$1" or "$3-bazoo") are variables which are substituted
with values supplied as part of the environment the message is passed in.
In the case of message boxes, the environment consists of the arguments of
the "list" message (possibly extrapolated from "bang", "float",
or other) that the message box is responding to. Thus, if a message box gets
"23 skidoo" and if it contains the text, "$2 until $1", out comes the message,
"skidoo until 23".

<P>Object boxes contain text which forms a message to be sent to Pd to create
and initialize the object. Here, $1, etc., are taken from the context in which
the patch was loaded. When the patch is a new document or opened from a file
the "$" variables are undefined. But if the patch is an abstraction (see the
next section) they are taken from the abstractions' creation arguments.

<P>Constructions such as "$1-x" are expanded by string concatenation. This
is the mechanism for making local variables. In particular, $0 is a counter,
where every patch gets its own value. In an abstraction this guarantees a unique
ID number to that abstraction, so sends and receives with names like "$0-bear"
can be used as local send/receive pairs. This is also useful for things like
array names, value names and text names (as defined in the text object).

<P>Occasionally, you may want to have double or triple substitutions; this can
be done one stage at a time by nesting abstractions (with each subpatch
adding its own $-variable to a symbol and passing that on as argument to a
further abstraction).

<P>For example, if you want to get dog-food, dog-ears, and cat-food, for
example, have an abstraction "a1" that invokes an abstraction "a2" twice, as
"a2 $1-food" and "a2 $1-ears", and then in a third patch call a1 twice, as
"a1 cat" and "a1 dog". Inside the four "a2" copies, $1 will evaluate to
"dog-food", "cat-food", "dog-ears", and "cat-ears".

<H3> <A id="s8">2.8. Subpatches</A> </H3>

<p>Pd offers two mechanisms for making subpatches, called "one-off subpatches"
and "abstractions". In either case the subpatch appears as an object box
in a patch. If you type [pd] or [pd my-name] into an object box, this creates
a one-off subpatch. For instance, in this fragment:

<P><IMG src="img/2.8.1.png" ALT="subpatch"></P>

<p>The box in the middle, if clicked on, opens the sub-patch shown here:

<P><IMG src="img/2.8.2.png" ALT="open subpatch window"></P>

<P>The contents of the subpatch are saved as part of the parent patch, in
one file. If you make several copies of a subpatch you may change them
individually.

<P>The objects [inlet], [inlet~], [outlet] and [outlet~], when put in a
subpatch, create inlets and outlets for the object box containing the subpatch.
This works equally for one-off subpatches and abstractions and only accept
control data messages. The [inlet~] and [outlet~] versions create inlets and
outlets for audio signals. Note you can also mix control messages in an [inlet~]
via its right outlet, but a signal outlet only takes signals. Inlets and outlets
appear on the invoking box in the same left-to-right order as they appear in the
subpatch.

<H3> <A id="s8.1">2.8.1. Abstractions</A> </H3>

<P>To make an abstraction, save a patch with a name such as "abstraction1.pd"
and then invoke it in an object box as [abstraction1]:

<P><IMG src="img/2.8.3.png" ALT="abstraction"></P>

<P>Here, we're invoking a separate file, "abstraction1.pd", which holds the
patch shown here:

<P><IMG src="img/2.8.4.png" ALT="abstraction example"></P>

<p>You may create many instances of [abstraction1] or invoke it from several
different patches; changing and saving the contents of [abstraction1] will
affect all invocations of it as they are created. An analogy from the "c"
programming language is that one-off subpatches are like bracketed blocks of
code and abstractions are like subroutines.

<P>Abstractions are instantiated by typing the name of a patch (minus the ".pd"
extension) into an object box. You may also type arguments; for instance if
you have a file "my-abstraction.pd" you may have [my-abstraction 5] to set the
variable $1 to 5. This is defined only for object boxes (not for messages) in
the abstraction (for message boxes, "$1", etc, have a different meaning as
described above). If you want to send a message with a $1 in the sense of a
creation argument of an abstraction, you must generate it with an object box
such as [float $1], [symbol $1], or perhaps [pack $1 $2], which may then be
sent to a message box.

<P>The corresponding feature in Max (both Opcode and Ircam) was the "#1"
construct. In a Max abstraction, "#1", etc., are replaced by the creation
argument. This has the disadvantage that you can't edit the abstraction as
instantiated in the patch since the "#" variables are substituted. In Pd the
"$" variables in object boxes are spelled literally as "$" variables so that
it's meaningful to edit them from within their calling patch. On the Pd side,
however, there is the disadvantage that it's confusing to have "$" expanded at
a different time in an object box than in a message box. In an object box, the
"$" argument is expanded at creation time, and in a message box, at message
time.

<P>A [clone] object is provided to automatically create and manage multiple copies
of an abstraction. You can use it to make voice banks for polyphonic synthesis,
for example.

<H3> <A id="s8.2">2.8.2. Graph-on-parent subpatches</A> </H3>

<p>If you open the "properties" dialog for a subpatch or an abstraction, you can
check the "graph on parent" box to have the controls of the subpatch/abstraction
appear on the parent. For instance, here is an invocation of [abstraction2]:

<P><IMG src="img/2.8.5.png" ALT="graph-on-parent abstraction"></P>

<p>Where the patch "abstraction2.pd" contains:

<P><IMG src="img/2.8.6.png" ALT="inside graph-on-parent abstraction"></P>

<p>Here, the number box in the abstraction shows up on the box that invoked
the abstraction. The "graph on parent" flag is set in the abstraction
(and is saved as part of the abstraction;) to set it, open the "properties"
dialog for the "abstraction2" canvas by right-clicking on any white space
in the patch.

<P>To open the subpatch, right click on the object and select "Open". It doesn't
work just to click on the object in run mode since clicks are sent to visible
controls and/or arrays.

<P>When the sub-patch is closed, all controls in it appear on the object
instead; so the number box in the sub-patch in the example above is the same
one as you see in the box. Only controls are made visible in this way.

<H3> <A id="s9">2.9. Numeric arrays</A> </H3>

<p>Linear arrays of numbers recur throughout the computer musician's bag of
tricks, beginning with the wavetable oscillator. The wavetable oscillator later
was reinvented as the looping sampler. Also, table lookup is used for nonlinear
distortion of audio signals. In the domain of control, arrays of numbers
can specify control mappings, probability densities, voicing data, and much
more.

<P>Arrays in Pd should be allocated (and possible read in from a file) before
beginning to make sound, since memory allocation and disk operations may take
long enough to cause audio buffer overruns or underruns. Pd provides two ways
to define new arrays, as "graphs" and "tables". In either case, the array
has a pre-defined name and size (i.e., number of points). Elements of the
array are stored as floating-point numbers, 4 bytes apiece.

<P>If you use an array to store a one-second sound at 44.1 kHz, you will need
176 kilobytes, for a one-minute sound 10.6 megabytes. To store a sound with
two or more channels, use a separate array for each channel.

<P>Arrays are also useful as transfer functions, for example for nonlinear
distortion of an audio signal, or to map a control onto a synthesis parameter.
In situations like this, one typically uses much shorter arrays of no more
than a few hundred elements. They are also useful for storing measured
spectra derived from the fft~ objects, and probably for many other uses.

<P>Arrays usually appear within subpatches created to house them, whether
in "graph on parent" form (so that you see them within a rectangle drawn on
the containing patch), or as a regular subpatch (which you see as a text box).
In the "graph on parent" form, an array appears as shown:

<P><IMG src="img/2.9.1.png" ALT="array"></P>

<P>Arrays are indexed from 0 to N-1 where N is the number of points in the
array. You can read an array value using the tabread object:

<P><IMG src="img/2.9.2.png" ALT="array indexing"></P>

<p>Here, we see that the third point of the array (index 2) has the value 0.4.
To write into the array, you can use the tabwrite object:

<P><IMG src="img/2.9.3.png" ALT="setting an value in an array"></P>

<p>In this example, sending the message sets the third element to 0.5. (You
may also send the two numbers to the two inlets separately.)

<P>The two previous examples showed control operations to read and write from
and to arrays. These may also be done using audio signals. For example,
the patch below creates a 440 Hz tone with "array1" as a waveform:

<P><IMG src="img/2.9.4.png" ALT="setting an array with a waveform"></P>

<p>Here, [phasor~] outputs a ramp whose output range is from 0 to 1, repeating
440 times per second. The multiplier and adder adjust the range from 1 to 11
and then the values are used as indices for [tabread4~], which is a 4-point
interpolating table lookup module. (Much more detail is available in the
"3.audio.examples" series in the documentation folder.)

<P>To create a new array, select "array" from the <b>Put menu</b>. A dialog
will appear to set initial properties of the array. By default, a new graph is
created to hold the array, but it may also be housed in the most recently
created graph instead. Other properties may be specified there and/or changed
later using the "properties" dialog.

<P>If you select "properties" on an array in a graph, you get two dialogs, one
for the array and one for the graph. The array dialog looks like this:

<P><IMG src="img/2.9.5.png" ALT="array properties window"></P>

<p>You may use this to change the name and size, in addition to another property,
"save contents". If "save contents" is selected, the array's values are stored
in the containing patch; otherwise they're initialized to zero each time the
patch is reloaded. If you intend to use arrays to store sounds, you will
probably not wish to store them in the patch but as separate soundfiles. This
will be more efficient and you may also then use a sound editor to modify them
outside Pd.

<P>If you check "Delete array" and then "OK", the array will be deleted. This
is an odd interface for deleting an object, and is only provided because Pd
lacks a mechanism for selecting arrays (so that "cut" could serve this purpose).

<P>The graph dialog (which also pops up) is shown here:

<P><IMG src="img/2.9.6.png" ALT="graph properties"></P>

<P>The X bounds initially range from 0 to the number of points in the table
minus one (this is a good choice for arrays, although graphs holding other
kinds of objects might require other X bounds). The Y bounds should be
chosen to reflect the natural range of the table, so that stored sounds
would naturally range from -1 to 1, but a sequence of frequency values might
range from 0 to 20,000. Finally, you choose the screen size of the graph,
width and height, in screen pixels.

<P>Many other operations are defined for arrays; see the related patches
in the tutorial (starting at 2.control/15.array.pd) for more possibilities.

<H3> <A id="s10">2.10. Data structures</A> </H3>

<p>(Note: this section is an adapted and updated version of an article
submitted to ICMC 2002.)

<P>The original idea in developing Pd was to make a real-time computer music
performance environment like Max, but somehow to include also a facility for
making computer music scores with user-specifiable graphical representations.
This idea has important precedents in Eric Lindemann's Animal and Bill Buxton's
SSSP. An even earlier class of precedents lies in the rich variety of paper
scores for electronic music before it became practical to offer a
computer-based score editor. In this context, scores by Stockhausen (<I>
Kontakte</I> and <I>Studie II</I>) and Yuasa (<I>Toward the Midnight Sun</I>)
come most prominently to mind, but also Xenakis's <I>Mycenae-alpha</I>, which,
although it was realized using a computer, was scored on paper and only
afterwards laboriously transcribed into the computer.

<P>Pd is designed to to offer an extremely unstructured environment for
describing data structures and their graphical appearance. The underlying
idea is to allow the user to display any kind of data, associating it in
any way with the display. To accomplish this Pd introduces a graphical
data structure, somewhat like a data structure out of the C programming
language, but with a facility for attaching shapes and colors to the data,
so that the user can visualize and/or edit it. The data itself can be edited
from scratch or can be imported from files, generated algorithmically, or
derived from analyses of incoming sounds or other data streams.

<P>There's a tutorial section dedicated to Data Structures (4.data.structures)
with many examples. Here is one simple example from this series (09.sequencer.pd)
with a very short musical sketch realized using Pd:

<P><IMG src="img/2.10.1.png" ALT="graphical score"></P>

<P>The example, which only lasts a few seconds, is a polyphonic collection of
time-varying noise bands. The graphical "score" consists of six objects, each
marked with a small blue rectangle at left and with data shapes: a black shape
to show dynamic and a colored shape to show changing frequency and bandwidth.
The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis, frequency (although,
as explained later, this behavior isn't built into Pd). The dynamic and frequency
shapes aren't constrained to be connected or even to be proximate, but since they
pertain to the same sound their horizontal positions line up. In this example the
last (furthest-right) object is percussive (as seen by the black shape) and has a
fixed frequency and bandwidth, whereas the large, articulated shape in the center
has a complicated trajectory in both frequency and dynamic. The color of the
frequency has no purpose, but could be used to determine a voice number to route it.

<P>Each object is thus composed of a combination of scalar values (color;
aggregate position in X and Y coordinates) and array values (time/envelope
pairs for the black traces and time/frequency/bandwidth triples for the
colored ones). This is all specified by the user using Pd's "template"
mechanism. Here is the template associated with the graphical objects shown
above.

<P><IMG src="img/2.10.2.png" ALT="template for graphical score"></P>

<p>Templates consist of a data structure definition (the [struct] object) and
zero or more drawing instructions (such as [filledpolygon] and [plot]). The
[struct] object gives the template the name "template-event". The data structure
is defined to contain three floating point numbers named "x", "y", and "color",
and two arrays, one named "pitch" whose elements belong to another template
named "template-pitch", and similarly for the array "amp" (both data structures
contain three floating point numbers named "x", "y", and "w", for x/y position
and width.)

<P>In general, data structures are built from four data types: scalar floats
and symbols, text and arrays (whose elements share another, specified template).
The contents of a Pd window themselves form a list. An array (Pd's correlate of
Max's [table] object) is implemented as a top-level data structure array whose
elements are scalars containing a single floating-point number.

<P>Data structures in Pd may nest arbitrarily deeply using the array and text
types. For example, a collection of sinusoidal tracks from an analysis engine
could be implemented as an array of arrays of (pitch, amplitude) pairs.

<P>After the [struct] object in the template shown above, the remaining three
objects are <I>drawing instructions</I>, first for a rectangle (with the
[filledpolygon] object), and then for two arrays (with the [plot] objects).
The various graphical attributes that are specified for drawing instructions
may be numerical constants or data structure field names; in the latter case
the value varies depending on the data. For instance, the second creation
argument to [plot] is the color. The first one plots "pitch" using the color
"color". In this way the color is attached to the "color" slot in the data
structure, so that color will vary according to its "color" slot. The second
[plot] plots the "amp" field and the color is given as 0, which is black.

<H3> <A id="s10.1">2.10.1. Traversal</A> </H3>

<P>Pd objects are provided to traverse lists and arrays, and to address elements
of data structures for getting and setting. Pd has no built-in sequencer, nor
even any notion that "x" values should be used as a time axis. (However, a
"sort" function is provided, which reorders a list from left to right, on the
assumption that users might often want to use Pd data collections as x-ordered
sequences.) Recording sequences of events into lists, and/or playing the lists
back as sequences, are functionalities that the user is expected to supply on
top of Pd's offerings, which, it is hoped, would allow those functionalities
within a much larger range of possibilities, to include random re-orderings of
events, score following, self-modifying scores, reactive improvisation, and
perhaps much more.

<P> Here is a patch showing how to implement the graphical sequence score shown
above. It uses the [clone] object to instantiate different copies of the [voice]
abstraction, which is responsible for playing back each voice from the score.

<P><IMG src="img/2.10.3.png" ALT="traversal example patch"></P>

<P>Traversal of data is made possible by adding a new type of atom, "pointer",
to the two previously defined types that make up messages (numbers and symbols).
Unlike numbers and symbols, pointers have no printed form and thus can't be
uttered in message boxes. Traversal objects such as [pointer] and [get](among
several others) can generate or use pointers. The pointer data type is also
integrated into pipe-fitting objects such as [pack], [unpack], and [route].
The [trigger] object also deals with pointers.

<P>In the patch shown above, the [pointer] object holds a pointer to the next
object to "play" (by sending it to a copy of the [voice] abstractions). The
pointer object takes a "traverse" message to set it to the head of the list
(named "pd-data"), and "next" messages to move to (and output) the next datum
in the list (i.e., the next in the list of six objects in the score). Let's
check the [voice] abstraction below.

<P><IMG src="img/2.10.4.png" ALT="[voice] abstraction"></P>

<P>The [pd sequence] subpatch takes care of sequencing the data structure
events.

<P><IMG src="img/2.10.5.png" ALT="[pd sequence] subpatch"></P>

<P>A second [pointer] object is used here as a storage cell for pointers just
as [float] is for numbers. The center of the sequencer is the [delay] object,
which must be fed the time difference between each event (including the
non-event of hitting "start") and the next. As we extract each of the six
objects in the score, we must wait the delay for playing that object, and
then send its pointer to other abstractions that read data from the 'pitch'
and 'amp' arrays. However, we have to inspect the object itself to know the
delay before playing it. So, in the loop, we peel off the first remaining
object to play and inspect the time difference between it and the previous
one, using this value to set the [delay] object.

<P>The time difference needed to set the [delay] object is obtained using the
[get template-event] object with the 'x' field. This is converted to incremental
time with [-], corrected for tempo, and fed to the [delay] object. Pd provides
the [get] and [set] objects for reading and writing values from data structures.
The [get] object shown here obtains the "x" and "y" fields of the current object.
The template name (template-event) is supplied to the [get] objects so that
they can look up the offset of the necessary field(s) in advance, for greater
run-time efficiency.

<P>Once the delay time has expired, the object's pointer is recalled with the
[pointer] object and sent to the [data-array] abstraction, which extracts the
pitch and dynamic breakpoints from the arrays (specified as the abstraction's
argument,) so it contains two sequencers itself. The nesting of the overall
structure of the sequencer patch mirrors the nesting of the original data
structures.

<P><IMG src="img/2.10.6.png" ALT="[data-array] abstraction"></P>

<P>More general patches can easily be constructed which access heterogeneous
lists of objects (having different templates). In this way, an arbitrarily
rich personal "score language" can be developed and sequenced.

<H3> <A id="s10.2">2.10.2. Accessing and changing data</A> </H3>

<P>In general, accessing or changing data is done via "pointers" to "scalars".
Numbers and symbols within scalars are accessed using the [get] object and
changed, in the same way, using [set]. Since lists and arrays are composed of
scalars, every actual number or symbol in a data heap will be a number or symbol
element of some scalar. To access them, it suffices to have objects to chase
down elements of lists and arrays (given either a global name or a pointer to
the containing scalar).

<P>Lists are traversed in the way shown above; to get to a sublist of a scalar,
the [get] object will provide a pointer, in the same way as it provides "float"
or "symbol" elements of scalars. For arrays, an [element] object is provided
which, given a scalar, a field name and a number, chases down the numbered,
scalar, element of the named array field.

<P>To alter "float" or "symbol" elements of scalars is straightforward
using the [set] object, but arrays and lists can't be set by assignment;
there is no suitable data type available within messages. Lists could
possibly be "settable" by passing pointers to other lists, but permitting this
would have required either automatically doing deep copies of data structures
to carry out the assignments, or else implementing a garbage collecting memory
management system, either of which would be difficult to realize within
real-time computation time constraints. Instead, all the data hanging from a
scalar is considered as belonging to that scalar, and is left in memory until
the scalar is deleted; the data may be changed atom by atom, but primitives
are not provided which would imply unpredictable execution times.

<P>The [getsize] and [setsize] objects are provided to access or change
the number of elements in the array. For lists, an [append] object
appends a new scalar for a given template to a list, after the element pointed
to. (To insert a scalar at the beginning of a list, the pointer can be set to
the "head" of the list, a formal location before the first list item.)
Deletion is less flexible; the only operation is to delete an entire list.
(There's no reason not to provide finer-grain deletion mechanisms except that
it's not clear how to protect against stale pointers efficiently, except by
voiding the entire collection of pointers into a list.)

<H3> <A id="s10.3">2.10.3. Editing</A> </H3>

<P>The graphical score shown above can be edited by dragging breakpoints, or
by adding and deleting them, using mouse clicks. Also, entire objects or
collections of them may be copied, pasted, and dragged around the screen.
Alternatively, there is an editable (or computer generate-able or parse-able)
text representation for the data, which may be seen or changed in a dialog
window or read and written to external text files.

<P>Since the graphical presentation of data objects is determined by drawing
instructions, the drawing instructions are interpreted backward to alter data
as a result of mouse operations. If a given graphical dimension is controlled
by a variable, that variable is then controlled by dragging along that
dimension; if the dimension is constant, it can't be altered by dragging.

<P>Tricky situations can arise when the user changes the contents of templates.
A change in drawing instructions can be accommodated by simply tracking
down and redrawing all data objects using the template. However, changing
the [struct] object itself make for less straightforward situations. The
user might wish to reorder fields, delete them, add new ones, or rename them.
When a [struct] object changes, Pd automatically conforms the data from the old
structure to the new one. Fields with the same name as previously are maintained
(reordering them as necessary;) and if a field disappears but another of the
same type appears, the new one(s) are taken to be renamings of the old one(s)
in order of appearance. New fields which cannot be matched in this way with
previously existing ones are assumed to be new and are initialized.

<P>It can happen that two [struct] objects compete to define the same data
structure, or that the user reads in data from a file which expects a different
version of the structure, or alternatively, that the [struct] object for
existing data objects disappears. For this reason, Pd maintains a private
representation of the last active version of a [struct] until all
similarly named "structs", as well as all data using that "struct", have
disappeared. If the user introduces a new version of the "struct" and only
later deletes the "current" one, the data is only conformed to the new version
once the old one is deleted. In this way we avoid getting into situations
where data is left hanging without its structure definition, or where data ends
up belonging to two or more structures of the same name. The worst that can
happen is that data may lose their drawing instructions, in which case Pd
supplies a simple default shape.

<H3> <A id="s10.4">2.10.4. Limitations</A> </H3>

<P>When examples get more complicated and/or dense than the one shown here, it
becomes difficult to see and select specific features of a data collection;
more work is needed to facilitate this. There should be some facility for
turning drawing instructions on and off, or perhaps for switching between versions
of a template, depending on the user's desired view. There should also be a
callback facility in the template for when an object is edited with the mouse, so
that the user can bind actions to mouse clicks.

<P>More generally, the collection of traversal objects that Pd provides is
adequate to support a variety of modes of data collection and use, such as
analysis and sequencing. But the patches required to traverse the data
collections are not always simple. It would be desirable to find a more
straightforward mechanism than that provided by the [pointer], [get]
and [set] objects.

<P>The "data" facility, although part of the original plan for Pd, has only
recently been implemented in its current form, and as (hopefully) the user base
grows there will surely be occasions for many further extensions of the data
handling primitives and the graphical presentation and editing functions.

<H3> <A id="s11"> 2.11. Differences from Max </A> </H3>

<P> Pd wasn't intended to be a Max clone, but there were many similarities between
Pd and Max/MSP in the of its origin and  some effort had been undertaken (but more
would have been needed) to make the two interoperable. It was possible to import
and export patches to Max/MSP; you just needed to save as text to a file with
extension ".pat", and then open in the other program. You'd at least get something.
By sticking to common or commonizable features youcould actually develop patches
for both platforms.

<P> To this day, Pd can still open and save MAX patches with the .pat extension as
well as MAX's text  files  with  the .mxt extension. However, these are legacy and
unsupported MAX formats as currently MAX uses a JSON-based file  format  with
the .maxpat extension introducd in MAX 5, released in 2008.

<P> Since MAX 5, MAX and Pd have diverged even more over the years, but Pd is still
closely related to MAX/MSP. Nonetheless, there are differences in semantics between
the two; a partial list follows.

<P> In Pd you can edit instantiations of abstractions and save the result back
to the file of the abstraction.  This isn't possible in Max, because the
instantiations are different from the abstraction itself in that "#1", etc.,
are replaced by the instantiation arguments.  In Pd, these arguments appear
as "$1", etc, and are translated at a slightly later stage of the instantiation
process so that you still see them as "$" variables in the instantiation.
see <A href="x2.htm#s8.1">Abstractions </A>.

<P> In Pd, to make current all instantiations of the abstraction, either delete
and recreate them or close and open the patch; this is done automatically in Max.

<P>  In Pd, if you select "save" while in a subpatch, the parent is saved. In
Max, if you do this a dialogue box comes up asking if you want to save the
subpatch as a separate file.  (if you want to save a subpatch to a file in Pd,
you have to copy and paste the contents to a new document.

<P> In Pd, inlets and outlets are ordinary text objects; in Max they're
"gui" objects from the palette.

<P> In Max, if an object's outlet is connected to several destinations,
corresponding messages are always sent in right-to-left screen order.  In
Pd, the messages are sent in the order you made the connections in.  In either
case, in situations where you care about the order it's appropriate to use
a [trigger] object to specify.

<P> In Pd, there's no [gate]; instead there's a [spigot] with the inlets in
the opposite, more natural order.

<P> Switching subsets of the DSP patch on and off is done in completely
different ways in Pd and Max, and block sizes are handled differently
as well.

<P> Max offers many "GUI" objects such as sliders, dials, VU meters, piano
keyboards, even "bpatchers." Until version 0.34, the only two in Pd were the
number box and graphical arrays.  Starting in version 0.34, Pd incorporates
Thomas Musil's GUI objects: sliders, switches, and so on.  (Thanks Thomas!)
Beyond this essential collection of GUI objects, it's unlikely you'll ever find
any commonality between the two.

<P> The "bpatcher" feature in Max has a correlate, "graph on parent" subpatches,
in Pd; however, Pd's version is quite different from Max's.

<P>  In Pd there's no [preset] object (I now think it's basically a bad idea)
and you have to use explicit sends and receives to restore values to number
boxes. Then just make a "message" box to re-send the values you want.

<P> In Macintosh land, instead of getting tabosc4~ and arrays, you get cycle~
and buffer~. The only gotcha is that you probably can't draw in buffer~ with
the mouse as you can with arrays, but at least it's possible to
make a patch that copies a "table" into a "buffer~".
