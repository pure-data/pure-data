<h3 id="macos-resources">macOS resources</h3>
<p>Directory pure-data/mac contains support files for building a Pure Data
macOS application bundle and supplementary build scripts for compiling
Pd on Macintosh systems, as it is built for the &lsquo;vanilla&rsquo; releases on
msp.ucsd.edu.</p>
<h3 id="pd-macos-app">Pd macOS app</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, a monolithic macOS &ldquo;application&rdquo; is simply a directory
structure treated as a single object by the OS. Inside this bundle are
the compiled binaries, resource files, and contextual information. You
can look inside any application by either navigating inside it from the
commandline or by right-clicking on it in Finder and choosing &ldquo;Show
Package Contents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The basic layout is:</p>
<pre><code>Pd-0.47-1.app/Contents
  Info.plist  &lt;- contextual info: version string, get info string, etc
  /Frameworks &lt;- embedded Tcl/Tk frameworks (optional)
  /MacOS/Pd   &lt;- renamed Wish bundle launcher
  /Resources
    /bin      &lt;- pd binaries
    /doc      &lt;- built in docs &amp; help files
    /extra    &lt;- core externals
    /font     &lt;- included fonts
    /po       &lt;- text translation files
    /src      &lt;- Pd source header files
    /tcl      &lt;- Pd GUI scripts
</code></pre>
<p>The Pure Data GUI utilizes the Tk windowing shell aka &ldquo;Wish&rdquo; at runtime.
Creating a Pure Data .app involves using a precompiled Wish.app as a
wrapper by copying the Pd binaries and resources inside of it.</p>
<h3 id="app-bundle-helpers">App Bundle Helpers</h3>
<ul>
<li>osx-app.sh: creates a Pd .app bundle for macOS using a Tk Wish.app
wrapper</li>
<li>tcltk-wish.sh: downloads and builds a Tcl/Tk Wish.app for macOS</li>
</ul>
<p>These scripts complement the autotools build system described in
INSTALL.txt and are meant to be run after Pd is configured and built.
The following usage, for example, downloads and builds a 32 bit Tk 8.6.6
Wish.app which is used to create a macOS Pd-0.47-1.app:</p>
<pre><code>mac/tcltk-wish.sh --arch i386 8.6.6
mac/osx-app.sh --wish Wish-8.6.6.app 0.47-1
</code></pre>
<p>Both osx-app.sh &amp; tcltck-wish.sh have extensive help output using the
&ndash;help commandline option:</p>
<pre><code>mac/osx-app.sh --help
mac/tcltk-wish.sh --help
</code></pre>
<p>The osx-app.sh script automates building the Pd .app bundle and is used
in the &ldquo;make app&rdquo; makefile target. This default action can be invoked
manually after Pd is built:</p>
<pre><code>mac/osx-app.sh 0.47-1
</code></pre>
<p>This builds a &ldquo;Pd-0.47-1.app&rdquo; using the included Wish. If you omit the
version argument, a &ldquo;Pd.app&rdquo; is built. The version argument is only used
as a suffix to the file name and contextual version info is pulled from
configure script output.</p>
<p>A pre-built universal (32/64 bit) Tk 8.6.10 Wish with patches applied is
included with the Pd source distribution and works across the majority
of macOS versions up to 10.15. This is the default Wish.app when using
osx-app.sh. If you want to use a different Wish.app (a newer version, a
custom build, a system version), you can specify the donor via
commandline options, for example:</p>
<pre><code># build Pd-0.47-1.app using Tk 8.6 installed to the system
mac/osx-app.sh --system-tk 8.6 0.47-1
</code></pre>
<p>If you want Pd to use a newer version of Tcl/Tk, but do not want to
install to it to your system, you can build Tcl/Tk as embedded
frameworks inside of the Pd .app bundle. This has the advantage of
portability to other systems.</p>
<p>The tcltk-wish.sh script automates building a Wish.app with embedded
Tcl/Tk, either from the release distributions or from a git clone:</p>
<pre><code># build Wish-8.6.6.app with embedded Tcl/Tk 8.6.6
mac/tcltk-wish.sh 8.6.6

# build Wish-master-git.app from the latest Tcl/Tk master branch from git
mac/tcltk-wish.sh --git master-git
</code></pre>
<p>You can also specify which architectures to build (32 bit, 64 bit, or
both):</p>
<pre><code># build 32 bit Wish-8.6.6.app with embedded Tcl/Tk 8.6.6
mac/tcltk-wish.sh --arch i386 8.6.6

# build universal (32 &amp; 64 bit)
mac/tcltk-wish.sh --universal 8.6.6
</code></pre>
<p>Once your custom Wish.app is built, you can use it as the .app source
for osx-app.sh with the -w/&ndash;wish option:</p>
<pre><code># build Pd with a custom Tcl/Tk 8.6.6 Wish
mac/osx-app.sh -w Wish-8.6.6.app
</code></pre>
<p>Downloading and building Tcl/Tk takes some time. If you are doing lots
of builds of Pd and/or are experimenting with different versions of
Tcl/Tk, building the embedded Wish.apps you need with tcltk-wish.sh can
save you some time as they can be reused when (re)making the Pd .app
bundle.</p>
<p>Usually, it&rsquo;s best to use stable releases of Tcl/Tk. However, there are
times when building from the current development version is useful. For
instance, if there is a bug in the Tcl/Tk sources and the generated
Wish.app crashes on your system, you can then see if there is a fix for
this in the Tcl/Tk development version on GitHub. If so, then you can
test by using the tcltk-wish.sh &ndash;git commandline option. Oftentimes,
these kinds of issues will appear with a newer version of macOS before
they have been fixed by the open source community.</p>
<p>Additionally, Pd uses an older version of Tcl/Tk for backwards
compatibility on macOS. As such, small bugfixes from newer versions may
need to be backported for the Pd GUI. Currently, this is handled in the
tcltk-wish.sh script by applying custom patches to either the Tcl and/or
Tk source trees. To skip applying patches, use the tcltk-wish.sh
&ndash;no-patches commandline option. See mac/patches/README.txt for more
info.</p>
<h3 id="supplementary-build-scripts">Supplementary Build Scripts</h3>
<ul>
<li>build-macosx: builds a 32 bit Pd .app bundle using src/makefile.mac</li>
<li>build-mac64: builds a 64 bit Pd .app bundle using src/makefile.mac</li>
</ul>
<p>These scripts automate building Pd with the fallback makefiles in the
src directory.</p>
<p>To build a 32 bit Pd, copy this &ldquo;mac&rdquo; directory somewhere like ~/mac.
Also copy a source tarball there, such as pd-0.47-1.src.tar.gz. Then cd
to ~/mac and type:</p>
<pre><code>./build-macosx 0.47-1
</code></pre>
<p>If all goes well, you&rsquo;ll soon see a new app appear named Pd-0.47-1.app.</p>
<p>If you want to build a 64 bit Pd, perform the same steps and use the
build-mac64 script:</p>
<pre><code>./build-mac64 0.47-1
</code></pre>
<p>Note: The &ldquo;wish-shell.tgz&rdquo; is an archive of this app I found on my mac:
/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.4/Resources/Wish
Shell.app</p>
<p>A smarter version of the scripts ought to be able to find that file
automatically on your system so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to include it here.</p>
<h3 id="preferences">Preferences</h3>
<p>The Pure Data preferences are saved in the macOS &ldquo;defaults&rdquo; preference
system using the following domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>org.puredata.pd: core settings (audio devices, search paths, etc)</li>
<li>org.puredata.pd.pd-gui: GUI settings (recent files, last opened
location, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>The files themselves live in your user home folder and use the .plist
extension:</p>
<pre><code>~/Library/Preferences/org.puredata.pd.plist
~/Library/Preferences/org.puredata.pd.pd-gui.plist
</code></pre>
<p>These files use the Apple Property List XML format and shouldn&rsquo;t be
edited directly. You can look inside, edit, and/or delete these using
the &ldquo;defaults&rdquo; commandline utility in Terminal:</p>
<pre><code># print the contents of the core settings
defaults read org.puredata.pd

# delete the current GUI settings
defaults delete org.puredata.pd.pd-gui

# set the startup flag in the core settings
defaults write org.puredata.pd -array-add flags '-lib Gem'
</code></pre>
<p>Some important per-application settings required by the GUI include:</p>
<ul>
<li>NSRecentDocuments: string array, list of recently opened files</li>
<li>NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows: false, disables default 10.7+ window state
saving</li>
<li>ApplePressAndHoldEnabled: false, disables character compose popup,
enables key repeat for all keys</li>
</ul>
<p>These are set in tcl/pd_guiprefs.tcl.</p>
<h3 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h3>
<p>As of Pd 0.51, the mac/osx-app.sh script performs &ldquo;ad-hoc code signing&rdquo;
in order to set entitlements to open un-validated dynamic libraries on
macOS 10.15+. This is required due to the new security settings. Note:
ad-hoc signing doesn&rsquo;t actually sign the .app bundle with an account
certificate, so the unidentified developer warning is still shown when
the downloaded .app is run for the first time.</p>
