<p><a href="index.html">back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>The following are basic instructions on how to get Pd installed and
running on your machine. More details are maintained online on the
<a href="http://www.pure-data.info/">pure-data.info</a> site.</p>
<p>Pd runs under Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. How to get Pd up and
running depends on your operating system, but the overall strategy is
the same. You must first get and install it, and then untangle whatever
problems arise in handling audio and MIDI input and output, and finally
get Pd to meet its real-time obligations reliably.</p>
<p>Installation instructions are platform-specific; the following three
sections will describe what to do for various operating systems you
might have. In case of trouble also consult the Pd mailing list archive
on <a href="https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-list">https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-list</a>. , which often has
late-breaking news about configuration problems and solutions. The rest
of this section describes how to get audio and MIDI to work.</p>
<h3 id="audio-and-midi">Audio and MIDI</h3>
<p>To test audio and MIDI, start Pd and select &ldquo;test Audio and MIDI&rdquo; from
the &ldquo;Media&rdquo; menu. You should see a window like this:</p>
<p><img src="x/img/fig11.1.png" alt="test tone patch"></p>
<p>First, try to get Pd to play a sine wave over your speakers. The &ldquo;TEST
TONE&rdquo; control at top left turns this on and off. Normally, all the
output channels are turned on so that when you turn the tone on (to a
soft -40 dB or a louder -20 dB) you should get output on the first eight
of your output channels. (If you have fewer than 8 output channels open,
the extra channels aren&rsquo;t played; and if you have more, this particular
patch won&rsquo;t use them.)</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anything wrong, the most likely outcome is that you will
hear nothing at all. This could be for any of at least three reasons: Pd
might have failed to open the audio device; the audio card&rsquo;s output
volume might be set to zero; or your audio system might not be set to
amplify the computer output.</p>
<p>The number boxes labeled &ldquo;AUDIO INPUT&rdquo; show the levels of incoming
audio, in dB, with 100 being maximum. (Incoming signals may clip at RMS
levels below 100; for instance, a sinusoid clips at about 97 dB.) Any DC
present in the input (such as you get with cheap audio hardware) will
show up as level unless you turn on the &ldquo;input hipass&rdquo; toggle at
right; then the DC component is filtered out before metering.</p>
<p>To test the quality of audio input and output, turn on &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; (also
at right) which causes the inputs to be played to the outputs at unit
gain. You should hear a faithful, non-distorted copy of whatever is sent
through the patch.</p>
<p>It is easy to get two copies of Pd running by accident; on most machines
only one at a time may be inputting and outputting sound. (Some copy of
Pd might have audio or MIDI devices open and prevent the copy you&rsquo;re
trying to use from getting access to them.) Having extra copies of Pd
around will also eat CPU cycles uselessly.</p>
<p>You may be interested in getting only audio output or audio input, or
you may need both to run simultaneously. By default, Pd will try to run
both, but if you don&rsquo;t need either input or output, you may find that
Pd runs more reliably, or at least more efficiently, with the unused
direction turned off. This may be specified in Pd&rsquo;s command line flags
or using the &ldquo;audio settings&rdquo; dialog panel.</p>
<p>Depending on your application you will have a more or less stringent
latency requirement. Ideally, when any input (audio, MIDI, keyboard,
network) is available, the outputs (in particular the audio output)
should react instantly. In real life, it is necessary to buffer the
audio inputs and outputs, trying always to keep some number of
milliseconds ahead of real time to prepare for the inevitable occasions
where the CPU runs off to service some different task from Pd. How small
this latency can be chosen depends on your OS and your audio driver.</p>
<p>TIP: If Pd starts up but you get distortion or glitches in the audio
output, this could be either because the &ldquo;audio I/O buffer&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t big
enough, or else because the CPU load of the patch you&rsquo;re running is too
great for the machine you have, or else because the ADC and DAC are out
of sync or even at different sample rates. To test for the first
possibility, try increasing the audio latency in the command line or the
&ldquo;audio settings&rdquo; dialog (but see also under your OS below.) For the
second, start up your favorite performance monitor program; and for the
third, try starting Pd up with ADCs disabled.</p>
<p>In addition to the &ldquo;test audio and MIDI&rdquo; patch, the &ldquo;Media&rdquo; menu
contains items for controlling audio and MIDI settings. The first two
items, &ldquo;Audio on&rdquo; and &ldquo;Audio off&rdquo;, open or close the audio devices
and start or stop Pd&rsquo;s audio computation.</p>
<p>If there is a choice of audio API to make, the Media menu will display
them. (On Linux, they are OSS, ALSA, and Portaudio; on Windows, you get
MMIO and ASIO). On Mac the only one is Portaudio. More information about
the APIs appears in the sections below.</p>
<p>Selecting an API (even if it&rsquo;s the one already in use), or,
alternatively, selecting &ldquo;Audio Settings&hellip;&rdquo; from Preferences, opens
a dialog panel like this:</p>
<p><img src="x/img/fig11.2.png" alt="audio settings dialog"></p>
<p>The exact choices you get depend on the operating system and API. The
sample rate controls both audio output and input. The audio throughput
delay is the nominal amount of time, in milliseconds, that a sound
coming into the audio input will be delayed if it is copied through Pd
straight to the output. Naturally you would like this to be as small as
possible, but, depending on OS, API, and even the specific choice of
audio hardware, there will be a limit to how small you can make this.
You can typically get 10 msec on Linux (and lower still if you use
special tricks), 30 msec on MacOS, and 60 msec on Windows (but note that
there might be ways that a patient Windows user can reduce this).</p>
<p>Next you get a choice of input and output device. If you want to open
more than one, hit &ldquo;use multiple devices&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll be allowed up to
4 in and 4 out. Each audio device is 2 channels by default, but you may
specify more if your hardware supports it. Other parameters may be
tweaked using the command line; see under <a href="getting-pd-to-run.html#preferences-and-startup-options">preferences and startup
options</a>.</p>
<h6 id="midi">MIDI</h6>
<p>The &ldquo;channel message&rdquo; midi objects in Pd such as notein or pgmout will
take channels 1-16 to mean the first open MIDI port, 17-32 the second
one, and so on. The midiin, sysexin, midiout objects give you a separate
inlet to specify which of the open MIDI port numbers you want.</p>
<p>System exclusive MIDI message input and output are theoretically
supported but does not work uniformly across all operating systems..</p>
<h3 id="installing-pd-in-microsoft-windows">Installing Pd in Microsoft Windows</h3>
<p>Pd should work under any version of Windows since XP. You can download
as a self-extracting archive (a &ldquo;.exe&rdquo; file). Run this and select a
destination directory when prompted, such as &ldquo;C:\pd&rdquo; or &ldquo;C:\Program
Files\pd&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If for example you put Pd in &ldquo;C:\Program Files\pd&rdquo;, the executable
program will be &ldquo;C:\Program Files\pd\bin\pd&rdquo;. You can simply adjust
your path to include &ldquo;C:\Program Files\pd\bin&quot; and then invoke &ldquo;pd&rdquo; in a command
prompt window. You can also make a shortcut to the executable program
(left-click on it and drag to the desktop, for example.)</p>
<p>Pd requires &ldquo;TCP/IP networking&rdquo; to be turned on. This doesn&rsquo;t mean
you have to be on a real network, but simply that Pd actually consists
of two programs that make a &ldquo;network link&rdquo; (locally) to
intercommunicate. The first time you run Pd the &ldquo;Windows Firewall&rdquo;
will ask your permission to allow this intercommunication.</p>
<h4 id="audio-in-microsoft-windows">Audio in Microsoft Windows</h4>
<p>Pd offers both the ASIO and MMIO APIs in Windows.</p>
<h4 id="asio">ASIO</h4>
<p>As of version 0.35 Pd supports ASIO. Invoke Pd as &ldquo;pd -asio&rdquo; and, if
needed, specify &ldquo;-audiodev&rdquo; (etc.) flags to specify which device (see
&ldquo;the Pd command line&rdquo; below.) You can also specify a &ldquo;-blocksize&rdquo;
different from the default (256 samples) and &ldquo;-audiobuf&rdquo; in
milliseconds. Pd will round this down to a power of two buffers, each of
&ldquo;-blocksize&rdquo; in sample frames.</p>
<p>TIP: You can use your built-in sound-card with the Universal ASIO Driver
For WDM <a href="http://www.asio4all.org/">http://www.asio4all.org/</a></p>
<h3 id="installing-pd-in-linux">Installing Pd in Linux</h3>
<p>What to do depends on which flavor of Linux you are running (e.g.,
Debian or Red Hat). The instructions here should work for Pd 0.33 and up
regardless of your situation. (If not, you can read the Pd mailing list
archives for recent problems; if you have found a new problem you&rsquo;re
welcome to post it to the list.)</p>
<p>Pd is available via the package systems for some Linux distributions,
but not always in the most recent version possible. It&rsquo;s relatively
easy to compile your own copy of Pd and that is the approach described
here.</p>
<h4 id="getting-pd-as-a-targz">Getting Pd as a .tar.gz</h4>
<p>Before you start, you might want to check that you have the resources Pd
needs. The main things you need are the C compiler, X windows (including
the X development package for Pd to link against), TK, and the ALSA
&ldquo;devel&rdquo; headers. It should be enough to load &ldquo;tcl-devel&rdquo;,
&ldquo;tk-devel&rdquo;, and &ldquo;alsa-devel&rdquo; packages using yum or apt-get.</p>
<p>There are two parallel compilation setups now available. The old one is
described here; as of 0.43 I still use that but I plan to discontinue
this for 0.44 and start using only the new one. The following
description applies to the old one. Look in the INSTALL.txt file to see
how to use the new one.</p>
<p>Download Pd, perhaps from <a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html">http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html</a> , to file
such as &ldquo;pd-linux-033.tar.gz&rdquo;. Open a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; window, cd to the
directory containing the file, and type the command,</p>
<pre><code>    tar xzf pd-linux-033.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>which creates a directory named &ldquo;pd&rdquo;. I do this from my home
directory. Next, compile it. &ldquo;cd&rdquo; to pd and read the INSTALL.txt, or
else just cd to &ldquo;pd/src&rdquo; and type</p>
<pre><code>    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
</code></pre>
<p>You can pass flags to &ldquo;configure&rdquo; to customize your compilation:</p>
<pre><code>    To enable debugging (and losing code optimization) add &quot;--enable-debug&quot;.
    To use Portaudio, add &quot;--enable-portaudio&quot;.
    To put Pd in /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin, add &quot;--prefix=/bin&quot;.
</code></pre>
<p>Alsa and Jack support should auto-configure, but &ldquo;&ndash;enable-alsa&rdquo; od
&ldquo;&ndash;enable-jack&rdquo; will force their inclusion.</p>
<p>After &ldquo;make&rdquo;, just type &ldquo;~/pd/bin/pd&rdquo; to run pd.</p>
<p>Alternatively, as superuser, you can run &ldquo;make install&rdquo; after &ldquo;make
depend&rdquo; and then anyone on your system can just type &ldquo;pd&rdquo; to run it.</p>
<h4 id="testing-audio-and-midi">Testing audio and MIDI.</h4>
<p>Next try audio. We want to know whether audio output works, whether
audio input works, and whether they work simultaneously. First run
&ldquo;aumix&rdquo; (or any newer audio mixer app) to check audio input and output
gains and learn which input (mic; line; etc.) is &ldquo;recording&rdquo;. Then
test audio output by running</p>
<pre><code>    pd -noadc
</code></pre>
<p>and selecting &ldquo;test audio and MIDI&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Media&rdquo; menu. You
should see a patch. Turn on the test tone and listen. Do the usual
where&rsquo;s-the-signal business.</p>
<p>Then quit Pd and test audio input via</p>
<pre><code>    pd -nodac
</code></pre>
<p>Re-open the test patch and hit &ldquo;meter&rdquo;; look at the levels. 100 dB is
a hard clip; arrange gains so that the input signal tops out around 80
or 90, but no higher.</p>
<p>Now see if your audio driver can do full duplex by typing &ldquo;pd&rdquo; with no
flags. If you see error messages involving /dev/dsp or /dev/dsp2,
you&rsquo;re probably not able to run audio in and out at the same time. If
on the other hand there&rsquo;s no complaint, and if the audio test patch
does what you want, you might wish to experiment with the
&ldquo;-audiobuffer&rdquo; flag to see what values of audio latency your audio
system can handle.</p>
<h3 id="audio-hardware-in-linux">Audio hardware in Linux</h3>
<p>Installing and testing audio and MIDI drivers in Linux can take days or
weeks. There appears to be no single place where you can get detailed
information on Linux audio.</p>
<p>There are two widely-used driver sets, called &ldquo;OSS&rdquo; and &ldquo;ALSA&rdquo;. ALSA
is included in the standard Linux kernel since 2.4 or so. However, for
some audio cards you can find newer versions than are included in the
kernel releases. You can get ALSA from <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">http://www.alsa-project.org/</a> .</p>
<p>ALSA is able to emulate OSS, so that you can usually run Pd using the
&ldquo;OSS&rdquo; driver settings even if it&rsquo;s actually ALSA that&rsquo;s running.</p>
<p>By default, Pd uses ALSA. You can ask Pd to use ALSA&rsquo;s OSS emulation by
adding the &ldquo;-oss&rdquo; flag to the command line or fooling with the
&ldquo;media&rdquo; menu items.</p>
<p>You can add ALSA devices by name on the Pd command line:</p>
<pre><code>    pd -alsaadd loupgarou
</code></pre>
<p>This instructs Pd to offer the &rsquo;loupgarou&rsquo; audio device in the Audio
Settings panel.</p>
<h4 id="experiences-with-particular-soudcards">Experiences with particular soudcards</h4>
<p>Here are some of my own experiences with sound cards so far. See also
the Pd mailing list archives.</p>
<h6 id="rme-9652-hammerfall">RME 9652 (Hammerfall)</h6>
<p>This is the best PCI sound card out there; it costs around $500 and has
3 ADAT I/O ports and one SPDIF. There is a &ldquo;baby hammerfall&rdquo; also,
which I think is the &ldquo;9632.&rdquo; DO NOT CONFUSE THE 9652/9632 WITH OTHER
RME BOARDS WHICH MIGHT NOT WORK WITH PD.</p>
<p>The easiest way to use Hammerfall boards in Pd is via ALSA and jack; but
you can use ALSA alone:</p>
<pre><code>    pd -alsa -channels 26
</code></pre>
<p>works for me.</p>
<h6 id="midiman">MIDIMAN</h6>
<p>Midiman sells PCI devices (delta 44, 66, 1010, and 1010LT) with between
4 and 10 channels in and out, for which there are ALSA drivers. These
are also very good, and they are a bit cheaper than Hammerfalls. The
driver name is &ldquo;ice1712&rdquo;.</p>
<h6 id="usb-sound-devices">USB sound devices</h6>
<p>Ed Kelly reports success with the Lexicon series of USB 1.0 devices
(e.g., the Omega Studio; apparently 4 channels in and 4 out). Also known
to work well is the Edirol box (2 channels in and out).</p>
<p>As of Sept. 2011, the only multi-channel USB device I&rsquo;ve been able to
use with Pd is the Native Instruments Traktor Audio series. (I have the
Audio Traktor 10 which does indeed get 10 discrete channels in and out;
the box is designed for turntables and the I/O is all RCA. I haven&rsquo;t
yet tested whether the inputs are RIAA equalized or flat. To run this
device you&rsquo;ll need to compile and install an ALSA snapshot from at
least September 2011. This won&rsquo;t start showing up in Linux distros for
at least some months.</p>
<p>The Alsa developer list is reporting progress on the M-audio Ultra
series, which goes up to 6 in and out (analog) with 2 more as SP/DIF.
Things work OK for input or output separately but &ldquo;full duplex&rdquo; (in
and out simultaneously) has sync problems.</p>
<h3 id="installing-pd-in-macos">Installing Pd in macOS</h3>
<p>Pd version 0.35 and up support macOS. Recent versions of Pd require 10.6
or up.</p>
<p>To install Pd you can always download the sources and compile them
yourself, or (easier) just download the Mac binary from the download
page: <a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html">http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html</a> or from the Pure Data
community site: <a href="https://puredata.info">https://puredata.info</a> This is in the form of a
compressed tar.gz archive; just double click on it to extract the Pd
application. Open this and you should be running.</p>
<p>You might get various warnings about Pd trying to open an internet port.
This is normal although some system administrators will prevent you from
doing this (in which case you can&rsquo;t run Pd on that machine).</p>
<h4 id="to-install-on-macos-from-source">To install on macOS from source:</h4>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;ve downloaded the source or the &ldquo;package&rdquo; you can always
compile Pd for yourself, whether to make your own improvements, or
possibly so that you can get the newest version before it shows up
compiled for macOS.</p>
<p>To be able to compile Pd, you must have Tcl/Tk installed in the standard
places. I think this is true for all reasonably recent releases of
macOS.</p>
<p>Overview: Just as for Linux, extract pd-#.#.#.tar.gz into a directory
such as ~/pd-0.47-1, cd to ~/pd-0.47-1, run:</p>
<pre><code>    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
</code></pre>
<p>Then type ~/pd-0.47-1/bin/pd to a shell and enjoy!</p>
<p>Detailed build instructions can be found in the INSTALL.txt included
with the Pd source distribution.</p>
<p>If you wish you can put a line such as,</p>
<pre><code>    alias pd ~/pd/bin/pd
</code></pre>
<p>in the file, ~/.tcshrc, so that you can later just type &ldquo;pd&rdquo; to a
shell. (The shell only reads the ~/.tcshrc file on startup, so this
won&rsquo;t take effect in any existing shells unless you specially type</p>
<pre><code>    source ~/.tcshrc
</code></pre>
<p>to them.)</p>
<p>Follow the general directions above for testing audio and/or MIDI as
needed.</p>
<p>To get MIDI working, you have to do the macOS magic to get a USB MIDI
interface installed. I&rsquo;ve seen this done with Midisport devices and I
think you just download the macOS driver and follow directions.</p>
<h3 id="preferences-and-startup-options">Preferences and startup options</h3>
<p>Pd&rsquo;s behavior may be customized to instruct it where to find files,
which audio devices to open, what font size to use, and so on. Most of
these may also be changed using the various dialogs you can open from
Pd&rsquo;s menus. Others take effect only when Pd starts up; some of these
appear on the &ldquo;startup&rdquo; dialog and some of them, too cranky to put in
a GUI, must be typed as <em>command line arguments</em> .</p>
<p>In addition to the Audio and MIDI settings (see <a href="getting-pd-to-run.html#audio-and-midi">Audio and MIDI</a>
), you can customize font size (from the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; menu), directories to
search for files (see <a href="getting-pd-to-run.html#how-pd-searches-for-files">How Pd searches for files</a> ), and additional
startup parameters described below.</p>
<p>All of these settings may be saved automatically between Pd sessions. It
is also possible to specify settings directly via the <em>command line</em> .
(A third mechanism, using configuration files, is deprecated and isn&rsquo;t
described here.) The Pd command line is described in the next section.
Command line settings, if given, each override the corresponding setting
that was saved from Pd.</p>
<p>The startup settings (i.e., those that take effect only when Pd is
started) are controlled using the &ldquo;startup&hellip;&rdquo; dialog from the File
menu. The dialog appears as follows:</p>
<p><img src="x/img/fig11.3.png" alt="startup dialog"></p>
<p>The slots at top each specify a binary &ldquo;library&rdquo; for Pd to load on
startup. These may be for Gem, pdp, zexy, iemlib, cyclone, and so on.
Typically, a single binary object (an &ldquo;extern&rdquo;) is left for Pd to load
automatically; startup library loading is appropriate for collections of
many objects specified by a single binary library. ( See
<a href="externals.html#">Externals</a> for more on externals and how to load them)</p>
<p>The &ldquo;defeat real-time scheduling&rdquo; control, if enabled, makes Pd run
without its usual effort to become a real-time process (whatever this
means in the operating system you are using.) In Unix, Pd must usually
be setuid to allow real-time scheduling at all.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;startup flags&rdquo; allow you to add to Pd&rsquo;s command line on startup.
This is specified as described below, except that the initial word,
&ldquo;pd&rdquo;, is understood. For example, putting &ldquo;-rt&rdquo; in this field sets
real-time scheduling; &ldquo;-sleepgrain 1&rdquo; sets the sleep grain to 1 (see
under MIDI below), and typing &ldquo;-rt -sleepgrain 1&rdquo; does both.</p>
<p>You may save the current settings for future Pd sessions with the &ldquo;save
all settings&rdquo; button; this saves not only the path but all other
settings as well.</p>
<p>Command line arguments</p>
<p>Pd may be run as a &ldquo;command line&rdquo; program from your &ldquo;terminal
emulator,&rdquo; &ldquo;shell,&rdquo; or &ldquo;MS-DOS prompt.&rdquo; In Windows, if Pd is
started using a &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; it is also run from a command line which
you can edit using the &ldquo;properties&rdquo; dialog for the shortcut. In any
operating system, Pd can be called from a script (called a <em>batch file</em>
on Windows or a <em>shell script</em> on macOS or Unix). The command line is
just a line of text, which should be of the form:</p>
<pre><code>    pd [options] [patches to open]
</code></pre>
<p>although you may have to specify a path (such as &ldquo;~/pd/bin/pd&rdquo; or
&ldquo;C:\program files\pd\bin\pd&rdquo;) so your command interpreter can find
Pd. Possible options include:</p>
<pre><code>audio configuration flags:

<p>Here are some details on some of the audio, MIDI, and scheduler options
(but see also the next section on file management.)</p>
<h4 id="multiple-devices">multiple devices.</h4>
<p>You can specify multiple MIDI input and output devices. For example,
&ldquo;pd -midiindev 3 -midioutdev 4,2&rdquo; asks for the third MIDI input device
and the fourth and second MIDI output device.</p>
<p>Audio device selection is similar, except that you can also specify
channels by device: &ldquo;-audioindev 1,3 -inchannels 2,8&rdquo; will try to open
device 1 (2 channels) and device 3 (8 channels.)</p>
<h4 id="sample-rate">sample rate.</h4>
<p>The sample rate controls Pd&rsquo;s logical sample rate which need not be
that of the audio input and output devices. If Pd&rsquo;s sample rate is
wrong, time will flow at the wrong rate and synthetic sounds will be
transposed. If the output and input devices are running at different
rates, Pd will constantly drop frames to re-sync them, which will sound
bad. You can disable input or output if this is a problem.</p>
<h4 id="audio-buffer-size-and-block-size">audio buffer size and block size</h4>
<p>You can specify an audio buffer size in milliseconds, typically between
10 and 300, depending on how responsive your OS and drivers are. If this
is set too low there will be audio I/O errors (&ldquo;data late&rdquo;). The
higher the value is, on the other hand, the more throughput delay you
will hear from the audio and/or control inputs (MIDI, GUI) and the audio
coming out.</p>
<p>You can also specify the audio block size in sample frames. This is 64
by default (except for MMIO for which it&rsquo;s 256), and may be 64, 128, or
256.</p>
<h4 id="midi-and-sleepgrain">MIDI and sleepgrain</h4>
<p>In Linux, if you ask for &ldquo;pd -midioutdev 1&rdquo; for instance, you get
/dev/midi0 or /dev/midi00 (or even /dev/midi). &ldquo;-midioutdev 45&rdquo; would
be /dev/midi44. In Windows, device number 0 is the &ldquo;MIDI mapper&rdquo;,
which is the default MIDI device you selected from the control panel;
counting from one, the device numbers are card numbers as listed by &ldquo;pd
-listdev.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;sleepgrain&rdquo; controls how long (in milliseconds) Pd sleeps between
periods of computation. This is normally the audio buffer divided by 4,
but no less than 0.1 and no more than 5. On most OSes, ingoing and
outgoing MIDI is quantized to this value, so if you care about MIDI
timing, reduce this to 1 or less.</p>
<h3 id="how-pd-searches-for-files">How Pd searches for files</h3>
<p>Pd has a search path feature; you specify the path on the command line
using the &ldquo;-path&rdquo; option. Paths may contain any number of files. If
you specify several files in a single &ldquo;-path&rdquo; option they&rsquo;re
separated by colons in Unix or semicolons in Windows.</p>
<p>You can see and edit the path while Pd is running using the &ldquo;path&hellip;&rdquo;
item in the &ldquo;File / Preferences&rdquo; menu:</p>
<p><img src="x/img/fig11.4.png" alt="startup dialog"></p>
<p>The path must be correctly set before you load a patch or it may fail to
find abstractions, etc., that are needed to construct the patch. When Pd
searches for an abstraction or an &ldquo;extern&rdquo; it uses the path to try to
find the necessary file. The &ldquo;read&rdquo; messages to qlists and arrays (aka
tables) do this too.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;use standard extensions&rdquo; is enabled, the usual &ldquo;extra&rdquo; directory
is also searched. This contains standard external objects like
&ldquo;sigmund~&rdquo; (as well as it&rsquo;s predecessor &ldquo;fiddle~&rdquo;) and
&ldquo;bonk~&rdquo;, and perhaps much more depending on the distribution of Pd
you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>You may save the current settings for future Pd sessions with the &ldquo;save
all settings&rdquo; button; this saves not only the path but all other
settings as well.</p>
<p>Path entries may be relative to the patch directory; for instance, if
your path has an item, &ldquo;../sound&rdquo;, and your patch is in &ldquo;my stuff/all
mine&rdquo;, then Pd will look in &ldquo;my stuff/sound&rdquo;. Spaces should be OK in
the path to the patch, but not in the path entry (../sound) itself. This
is useful if you have a patch and supporting files (even a supporting
snapshot of pd) that you want to distribute or carry around together.</p>
<p>Regardless of path, Pd should look first in the directory containing the
patch before searching down the path. Pd does not automatically look in
the <em>current directory</em> however; to enable that, include &ldquo;.&rdquo; in the
path. The &ldquo;extra&rdquo; directory, if enabled, is searched last.</p>
<p>Filenames in Pd are always separated by (Unix-style) forward slashes,
even if you&rsquo;re on Windows (which uses backslashes). This is so that
patches can be ported more easily between operating systems. On the
other hand, if you specify a filename on the command line (as in &ldquo;pd
-path c:\pdlib&rdquo;) the file separator should agree with the operating
system.</p>
<p>A filename specified in a patch with any &ldquo;/&rdquo; characters in it (such as
&ldquo;../sounds/sample1.wav&rdquo;) causes Pd to to look both in the path and
relative to the directory containing the patch. You may also invoke
externs that way. ( See <a href="externals.html#">Externals</a> for more on externals and
how to load them)</p>
<p>As of version 0.35, there may be spaces in the path to Pd itself; also,
the &ldquo;openpanel&rdquo; and &ldquo;savepanel&rdquo; objects can handle spaces. Spaces in
the path should work as of version 0.38.</p>
