to get it.

This Manual has six sections:

<OL>
<LI> this introduction
<LI> <A href="x2.htm">
    a theory of operations, explaining how Pd works </A>
<LI> <A href="x3.htm">
    instructions on installing Pd and getting it to run </A>
<LI> <A href="x4.htm"> externals </A>
<LI> <A href="x5.htm"> release notes and known bugs </A>
<LI> <A href="x6.htm"> installing from source </A>
</OL>

<P>
For a list of all the objects you can use menu <b>Help/List of objects</b>. To get help on any
Pd object you can right click on it; or you can browse the help patches
by choosing menu <b>Help/Browser</b> and looking in
"Pure Data/5.reference".

<P>
The "example" patches are also available from Pd's browser. They appear in subdirectories 
named "2.control.examples", "3.audio.examples" and "4.data.structures". Some additional 
patches in "7.stuff" might also be helpful.

<P>
To get started writing your own C extensions, refer to "6.externs". For more about externals, 
please refer to <A href=x4.htm>chapter 4 </A>of this manual.

<H3> <A id=s2> 1.2. other resources </A> </H3>

<P> There is a very extensive Pd community web site,
<a href="http://www.pure-data.info/"> pure-data.info</a>, which aims to be the central resource for Pd, 
from documentation and downloads; to forums, member pages, and a patch exchange. You can check
<A href=https://puredata.info/docs/> https://puredata.info/docs/</A> for more documentation.

<P>
Most of the interesting news related to Pd shows up on the Pd mailing list,
maintained by IOhannes zm&ouml;lnig.  To subscribe or browse the archives
visit:
    <A href="https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-list">
    https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-list</A>.

This is the
best source of recent information regarding installation problems and bugs.  It
is perfectly reasonable to post "beginner" questions on this list; alternatively
you can contact msp@ucsd.edu for help.

<P> Many extensions to Pd are announced on the mailing list. In particular,
for people interested in graphics, there is a 3D graphics rendering package,
named GEM, based on OpenGL, written by Mark Danks, adapted to Linux by
Guenter Geiger, and now maintained by IOhannes zm&ouml;lnig. You can get
it from: <A href="http://gem.iem.at/">http://gem.iem.at/</A>, via "Find externals" in the
'Help Menu' or package manager of your Linux distribution. Another option is Ofelia, a Pd external
that allows you to use openFrameworks and Lua within Pd for creating audiovisual artwork 
or multimedia applications such as games. Get it also via "Find externals" or from
<A href="https://github.com/cuinjune/Ofelia">https://github.com/cuinjune/Ofelia</A>.
