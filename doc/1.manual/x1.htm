<H2>Chapter 1: Introduction</H2>

<P>
<A href="index.htm#s1"> back to table of contents </A>
<BR><BR>
</P>

<P> This is the HTML Manual for Pd (Pure Data), a patchable computer music environment
for audio analysis, synthesis and digital signal processing in real time (AKA Live
Electronics). Pd can also be extended via externals to include yet more computer
music features, multimedia capabilities and more. The latest version of this manual is
found online at <A href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html"> http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html</A>,
along with the downloads of the latest Pd releases.


<H3> <A id=s1.1> 1.1. Guide to Pd's documentation </A> </H3>

<P> The Pd's documentation includes more things besides this HTML Manual. As part of Pd's download
you can find the "doc" folder with more documentation resources. This is also accessible via the
<b>Help menu</b>, but let's first have a look at the folder structure inside the computer application.
In the 'doc' folder you find:

<UL>
<LI>This HTML manual<br>
<PRE>
Pd/
├── doc/
    ├── 1.manual/
</PRE>

<P>
This Manual has six sections:

<OL>
<LI> This <A href="x1.htm"> Introduction </A>
<LI> A <A href="x2.htm"> Theory of operations</A>, explaining how Pd works.
<LI> Instructions on <A href="x3.htm"> Installing and configuring Pd</A>
<LI> Information on managing <A href="x4.htm"> Externals </A>
<LI> A changelog at <A href="x5.htm"> Current status </A>
<LI> Instructions on <A href="x6.htm"> Building Pd from source </A>
</OL>

</br>

<LI>Next, there's a series of example tutorials, staring with the "control examples", which serves
    as a tutorial for Pd's "control" structure, as opposed to its audio functions (covered next).
    
<PRE>
Pd/
├── doc/
    ├── 2.control.examples/
</PRE>


<LI>The "audio examples" is actually a set of examples that are part of a book by Miller Puckette
    called "The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music". The book is freely available online at
    <A href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm"> http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm</A>.

<PRE>
Pd/
├── doc/
    ├── 3.audio.examples/
</PRE>

<LI>The last tutorial is for the Data Structures facilities, also described in this manual in
    section <A href="x2.htm#s2.10">2.10 Data Structures</A>.
<PRE>
Pd/
├── doc/
    ├── 4.data.structures/

<LI>Next, in the "reference" folder, you find help patches for all objects in Pd<br>
<PRE>
Pd/

    ├── 5.reference/

<LI>A sample C code on how to write externals is also provided in the next folder. More
    on externals is found in this manual at <a href="x4.htm">Chapter 4: Externals </a>.
<PRE>
Pd/

    ├── 6.externs/

<LI>There's also some "stuff", which are additional patches that might also be helpful.
<PRE>
Pd/

    ├── 7.stuff/
</PRE>

<LI>The last subfolder in the 'doc' folder includes extra documentation with more details on
    specific topics that is referred in the help files.

<H3> <A id=s1.2> 1.2. The Help menu </A> </H3>

<P> This section describes the <b>Help menu</b> of the Pd application, which offers shortcuts
to the documentation and other resources. The "Pd Help" entry opens this HTML manual.

    <figcaption>The Help menu</figcaption>
</figure>

<P> The "browser" opens the browser window. The "Pure Data" folder is actually the 'doc' folder
mentioned above, with all of its subfolders. You can then use this facility to navigate and open
particular help files, manual chapters, examples from the tutorials, etc.

<figure>
<IMG src="img/1.2.2.png" ALT="browser">
    <figcaption>The Help browser accessing the Pd's documentation folder</figcaption>
</figure>

<P> You will also find in this browser window the installed "Externals" in your system. By default,
Pd comes with an 'extra' library, so you'll find these externals here even if you haven't installed
anything.

<P> The 'List of objects' entry of the <b>Help menu</b> opens a patch that includes a list of all
Pd's native objects, which you can use to get an overview of all objects and ask help for a particular
object.

    <figcaption>The help-intro patch with a list of all internal objects</figcaption>
</figure>

<P> The 'puredata.info' entry opens <a href="http://www.pure-data.info/">
pure-data.info</a>, an extensive Pd community web site that aims to be the central
resource for Pd, from downloads to forums, member pages, extra documentation resources
and a patch exchange.

<P> The 'check for updates' entry just opens <a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html">
http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html</a> for you to check if there is a new Pd version for
download.

<P> The 'report a bug' entry opens the <A href=https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/issues>
    Pd issue tracker</A> on github, where you can find known bugs and also report them.

<P> For last, the <b>Help menu</b> also helps you find and download eternals with the "Find
externals" entry, which opens a Pd extension manager described in
<A href="x4.htm#s4.2.2">4.2.2 How to Download Externals from Pd</A>.


<H3> <A id=s1.3> 1.3. Other resources </A> </H3>

<P> The Pd source code is found on github, see
<A href=https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/> Pd GitHub project page</A>. As mentioned,
this is where you can find known bugs and also report them. There's also a repository that
focuses on Pd's documentation, called <A href=https://github.com/pure-data/pddp>
pddp (Pure Data Documentation Project)</A>. This repository also has an
<A href=https://github.com/pure-data/pddp/issues> issue tracker</A> for issues related to
the documentation.

<P> Most of the interesting news related to Pd shows up on the Pd mailing list,
maintained by IOhannes zm&ouml;lnig. To subscribe or browse the archives
visit: <A href="https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-list">
https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-list</A>. This is the best source of
recent information regarding installation problems and bugs. It is perfectly
reasonable to post "beginner" questions on this list; alternatively you can
contact msp@ucsd.edu for help. Many extensions to Pd are announced on the
mailing list.

<P> Other community resources online include the <A href="http://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/">
Pd forum </A>; a <A href="https://telegram.me/puredata ">Pd telegram group</A>; a
<A href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/4729684494 ">Facebook group</A> and a
<A href="https://discord.gg/bcPZcKQkmW">Discord channel</A>. Here you can find many users
that can help you with basic instructions and troubleshooting as well as other interactions
with the comminity.

<!--- comment out
In particular,

for people interested in graphics, there is a 3D graphics rendering package,

named GEM, based on OpenGL, written by Mark Danks, adapted to Linux by

Guenter Geiger, and now maintained by IOhannes zm&ouml;lnig. You can get

it from: <A href="http://gem.iem.at/">http://gem.iem.at/</A>, via "Find

externals" in the <b>Help Menu</b> or package manager of your Linux distribution.

Another option is Ofelia, a Pd external that allows you to use openFrameworks and

Lua within Pd for creating audiovisual artwork or multimedia applications such as

games. Get it also via "Find externals" or from

<A href="https://github.com/cuinjune/Ofelia">https://github.com/cuinjune/Ofelia</A>.
