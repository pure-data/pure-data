This Manual has six sections:

<OL>
<LI> This introduction
<LI> <A href="x2.htm"> A theory of operations, explaining how Pd works </A>
<LI> <A href="x3.htm"> Instructions on installing Pd and getting it to run </A>
<LI> <A href="x4.htm"> Externals </A>
<LI> <A href="x5.htm"> Current status </A>
<LI> <A href="x6.htm"> Installing from source </A>
</OL>

<P> For a list of all the objects you can use menu <b>Help/List of objects</b>.
To get help on any Pd object you can right click on it; or you can browse the
help patches by choosing menu <b>Help/Browser</b> and looking in
"Pure Data/5.reference".

<P> The "example" patches are also available from Pd's browser. They appear in
subdirectories named "2.control.examples", "3.audio.examples" and
"4.data.structures". Some additional patches in "7.stuff" might also be helpful.

<P>To get started writing your own C extensions, refer to "6.externs".
For more about externals, please refer to <A href=x4.htm>chapter 4 </A>of this manual.

<H3> <A id=s2> 1.2. Other resources </A> </H3>

<P> There is a very extensive Pd community web site, <a href="http://www.pure-data.info/">
pure-data.info</a>, which aims to be the central resource for Pd, from documentation and
downloads; to forums, member pages, and a patch exchange. You can check
<A href=https://puredata.info/docs/> https://puredata.info/docs/</A>
for more documentation.

<P> Most of the interesting news related to Pd shows up on the Pd mailing list,
maintained by IOhannes zm&ouml;lnig. To subscribe or browse the archives
visit: <A href="https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-list">
https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-list</A>. This is the best source of
recent information regarding installation problems and bugs. It is perfectly
reasonable to post "beginner" questions on this list; alternatively you can
contact msp@ucsd.edu for help.

<P> Many extensions to Pd are announced on the mailing list. In particular,
for people interested in graphics, there is a 3D graphics rendering package,
named GEM, based on OpenGL, written by Mark Danks, adapted to Linux by
Guenter Geiger, and now maintained by IOhannes zm&ouml;lnig. You can get
it from: <A href="http://gem.iem.at/">http://gem.iem.at/</A>, via "Find externals" in the
'Help Menu' or package manager of your Linux distribution. Another option is Ofelia, a Pd external
that allows you to use openFrameworks and Lua within Pd for creating audiovisual artwork
or multimedia applications such as games. Get it also via "Find externals" or from
<A href="https://github.com/cuinjune/Ofelia">https://github.com/cuinjune/Ofelia</A>.

<H3> <A id="s3"> 1.3. Github repository; Known bugs and bug reports</A> </H3>

<P> The Pd source code is also found on github, see
<A href=https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/> Pd GitHub project page</A>.

<P> The Pd repository is where you can find known bugs and also report them,
see <A href=https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/issues> Pd issue tracker</A>.

<P> There's also a repository that focuses on Pd's documentation, called
<A href=https://github.com/pure-data/pddp>
pddp (Pure Data Documentation Project)</A>. This repository
also has an <A href=https://github.com/pure-data/pddp/issues> issue tracker</A>
for issues related to the documentation.
