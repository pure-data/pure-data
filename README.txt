# Pure Data

Pure Data (Pd) is a free and open-source real-time computer music system. It provides a graphical programming environment that enables musicians, artists, and researchers to create interactive audio and multimedia applications. Pd is available for Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.

## Getting Pd

You can download Pd from the official website at http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html or from the Pure Data community site at https://puredata.info. Installation instructions are provided in the INSTALL.txt file and the Pd Manual, which can be found at http://msp.ucsd.edu/Pd_documentation/index.htm. If you download and unpack Pd, you will also find the Manual locally in the doc/1.manual/index.htm file.

On Linux (or FreeBSD), you can download Pd via your package manager, e.g., apt-get install puredata or dnf install puredata. Alternatively, you can download the source and compile it as described in INSTALL.txt.

On macOS, Pd binaries are distributed as a .tar.gz file. The web browser will probably download this archive into your Downloads folder. Double-click to extract the archived Mac app, which you can then run and/or drag into your Applications folder.

On Microsoft Windows, Pd binaries are distributed as a self-extracting executable or as a .zip file.

Once you have installed Pd, you can start using it to create your own audio and multimedia applications. Pd provides a visual programming interface where you can create patches by connecting objects together to form signal processing chains. You can use Pd to generate sounds, control synthesizers, process audio and video streams, create interactive installations, and much more.

Pd supports many third-party extensions, including libraries for adding video and 3D graphics. You can use the "Find externals" command in Pd's Help menu to browse and install these extensions.
