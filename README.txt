This is the README file for Pd, a free real-time computer music software
package resembling Max.  You can get Pd for Linux, Windows, Mac OSX, or IRIX
from http://www.crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/software.html or ftp://felix.ucsd.edu.  
Installation instructions are in the HTML DOCUMENTATION at:

    http://www.crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/Pd_documentation/index.htm

If you download and unpack Pd, you will also find the html documentation
locally in the file, .../pd-whatever/doc/1.manual/index.htm.  To unpack Pd:

LINUX (or freeBSD).  Download Pd, which will be a ".tar.gz" file; to unpack it,
type "zcat [name].tar.gz | tar xf -" to a shell.  This creates a directory with
a name like "pd-0.35".  There are also RPMs available.

Microsoft Windows.  Pd is distributed as a "zip" file.   Unzip this,
creating a directory such as \pd.

IRIX.  Download Pd, which will be a "tar.Z" file.  You can unpack this by
typing "zcat [name].tar.Z | tar xf -" to a shell.  

Macintosh.  The web browser will automatically unpack the distributions
into a folder such as "pd-0.35" on your desktop.
