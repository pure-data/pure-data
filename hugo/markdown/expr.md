The **expr** family is a set of C-like expression evaluation objects for the graphical music language Pure Data. It used to come as an 'extra' external, but it is now a built-in native object.

**expr** runs in control rate and evaluates C-like expressions. See below for the list of operators. Multiple expressions separated by semicolons can be defined in a single expr object and this results in multiple outlets (up to 100, each for each expression). Expressions are evaluated from right to left (which means that the bottom expression will be the first executed.) The number of inlets in expr are defined by variables that take a few different forms: **$i#**, **$i#** and **$s#** for 'integers', 'floats' and 'symbols' ('#' is an inlet number from 1 up to 100, ordered from left to right). As an example, we can have 3 inlets defined as "$i1", "$f2" and "$s3", where:

- **$i1** is the input from the first (left) inlet and is treated as an integer
- **$f2** is the input from the second (middle) inlet and is treated as a float
- **$s3** is the input from the third (middle) and expects a symbol (used to define array names)

Arrays and variables (defined using the 'value' object) can be accessed the same way one dimensional arrays are accessed in C; for example, "valx + 10" will be evaluated to the value of variable 'valx' + 10 and "tabname[5]" will be evaluated to be the 5th element of an array named "tabname". As shown above, the name of the arrays can be given by an input; for example "$s2[5]" will be evaluated to be the 5 element of the array whose symbol has been passed in inlet 2.

Type conversion from a float input to an integer is done automatically if the inlet is defined as an integer. Conversely, you can convert it explicitly by using functions (see below for the list of functions).

**expr~** is designed to efficiently combine signal and control stream processing by vector operations on the basis of the audio block size. The operations, functions, and syntax for **expr~** is just like expr with the addition of the $v# variable for signal vector input (also numbered up to 100). The **'$v'** is needed at least for the first and main input, so:

- **$v1** - means the first inlet is a signal input
- **$i2** - means the second inlet is an integer input
- **$f2** - means the third inlet is a float input
- **$s4** - means the fourth inlet is a symbol input

The result of an expression from expr~ is also an audio signal and multiple expressions up to 1000 can also be defined via semicolons.

Note for MSP users: Currently in the MSP version all signal inputs should come first followed by other types of inlet. (There seems to be no way of mixing signal and other types of inlets in their order in Max/MSP, if you know otherwise, please let me know.) This means that signal inlets cannot be mixed with other types of inlets. For example, "expr~ $v1$f2$v3 " is not legal. The second and third inlet should be switched and "expr~ $v1$v2$f3" should be used. In Pd you can mix them in any way you want.

The **fexpr~** object provides a flexible mechanism for building FIR and IIR filters by evaluating expressions on a sample by sample basis and providing access to prior samples of the input and output audio streams. When fractional offset is used, **fexpr~** uses linear interpolation to determine the value of the indexed sample. The operations, functions, and syntax for expr~ is just like expr with the addition of **$x#** and **$y#** variables. **fexpr~** can access previous input and output samples up to the block size (64 by default).

**$x#** is used to denote a signal input whose samples we would like to access. The syntax is $x followed by '#' (the inlet number up to 100) and the samples indexed by brackets, for example $x1[-1] specifies the previous sample of the first inlet. Therefore, if we are to build a simple filter which replaces every sample by the average of that sample and its previous one, we would use " **fexpr~ ($x1[0]+$x1[-1])/2** ". For ease of when the brackets are omitted, the current sample is implied, so we can write the previous filter expression as follows: " **fexpr~ ($x1+$x1[-1])/2** ". To build IIR filters **$y#** is used to access the previous output samples indexed from -1 inside brackets. Note now that '#' here is used to define the outlet number.

- **$x1[n]** - means the first inlet is a signal input and 'n' is an index from 0 to -block size
- **$y1[n]** - is used to access output samples from the first expression and 'n' is an index from -1 to -block size
- **$i2** - means the second inlet is an integer input
- **$f2** - means the third inlet is a float input
- **$s4** - means the fourth inlet is a symbol input
