---------------- dolist --------------------

GUIs: slider, etc "clip (pre-0.46) " (on for old ones, off by default)
toggle to get "track value (pre-0.46)"

x_text.c:
text dimension setting (message or creation arg - how to do it in structs?)
copying ala text_define_topointer
"open" and "save as" messages to open text window
how to integrate message boxes !?

x_array.c:
allow for lying about x and y labels
no-mouse, quantize and clip flags for plotting/mousing
save ticks, labels, other flags (and add dialog to set them)
array y range to reflect y increment sign (so no 1 to -1 range)
array search and array sort objects
maybe: array segment, array spline, array sinesum, etc? or array gen?  or
array forward (forwards message to defining array)
Is there a way to generate a pointer to an anonymous array? (do we need that?)

OS specific:
linux:
  rpm packages; BSD versions (set up VMs for testing)
windows:
  put call to PA_Terminate back in where appropriate (first test on windows)
  "-audiodev" with no args in registry can't start up?
  mmio out of portaudio but consider adding wdmks
mac:
  check if window titles wrong on Macintosh
  clicking on windows seems sometimes not to open them
  compile for jack on OSX by default (32 bit version at least).
  turn on paMacCore_ChangeDeviceParameters for mac (pa_mac_core.h)

problems:
fix behavior when dragging object outside screen (stop the evil auto-scrolls)
pd~ "start" followed by messages gives race condition because of "fromgui" biz
pd~ deadlock protection
find asdf$1 (e.g.) doesn't work
objects on GOP don't erase if you edit the GOP while they're showing
add -stack option to make 'regular' stack larger
menu item to save help patches to directory
look again at array vis/invis conundrum, g_template.c
floor, ciel functions in expr misdeclared
graph names don't appear until graph moved? (invis/vis on new array/rename)
don't filter locked click() through getrect
patcher inlets don't deal with scalars (zbug.pd)
read xx.txt in "bad" gives warnings
Krzysztof's qlist_next reentrancy bug
don't draw in/outlets on gui objects in graph-on-parent
get rid of messages causing renaming; try to prevent patches closing themselves.
scofo reports error on reading score1.txt
better error message for adc~ / dac~ reblocking
fix limitations in number of array elements that can be graphed

more demonstration patches:
vibrato using variable delay
real-time spectrum grapher
document ||, |, etc, better

features:
-nomidibuf flag (Nicola Pandini on pd list Aug 8 2013)
add way to query readsf~ for fill pointer (sf feature request 3598776)
'route' object to sprout inlet if no args (like sel)
optionally suppress leading "." directories and files on "open"
"installation mode": flag or messages to suppress menus&accelerators,
  and invisibilize Pd window
sigmund~: sort by pitch; pitch estimate to include pitch height; message
  to lie about previous track output
expr to parse exponential notation
mem alignment for SSE
replace gatom_escapit with a quoting mechanism (handle '[', spaces, etc.)
poly inlet to turn stealing on/off, plus mode to handle note-with-duration
integrate video into tilde objects
think of a way to embed abstractions in a patch (zlib?)
delete-in-rectangle message to Pds
put serial object in main dist (see rat@telecoma, Apr. 25; winfried May 22)
see x_list.c for more "list" object ideas
open64() for linux (if 32 bits, close soundfile and open64 it)

paths:
fix declare to update current patch when changed
open_via_path call in d_soundfile.c isn't threadsafe
open/save panel to take messages to set extent list
new open_via_path to take list of extents

editing:
control-enter to deselect an object?
pasting should look at current mouse location
clickless connection (hit 'c' key? see Bouchard paper)
tab to jump to a connected object (first one?) (shift-tab to back up?)
arrow keys to shift connections left and right
menu item to connect selected objects
highlight connections (and I/Os) on mouse motion
select line and hit "insert" to interpolate an object
option-drag an outlet to make a new, connected object
make a way to make multiple connections
"fix width" menu item
close-subwindows menu item
canvas zooming (use tcl/tk canvas scale command?)

data:
add -x [-n?] flag to drawnumbers
flag to disable edits for arrays
make a 2-pass process for finding hot spot closest to any given click
hooks for table mousing, other changes (scalars?)
data to save as succession of "list" messages that textfile can store, etc.
data copy/paste doesn't check templates aren't changed
pointer == and select equivalents
cursor to show (x, y) location and/or what parameter is being set to what
improve typing at drawnumbers
append doesn't do symbols yet.
non-clickable arrays (plus arrays that respond more easily than default)
set -any, get -any
build out scalar object - naming; "scalar set/get" objects
pointer methods to search and delete
optimize by pre-fetching field name offsets in accessor objects
double-click on drawtext in scalar to create editor window

more features:
signal inlets to sense signals; fix +~ etc, vcf~, biquad~, other filters
message dialog not to disappear
show results of opening MIDI on dialog
new: abs~, nexttick~, extend threshold~ and snapshot~ (vthreshold~ etc)
netsend separate thread
in glist_delete, consider why this can't be just "vis 0" -- why do we need it?
closebang and initbang
put in something for tilde order forcing
extensible "toolbar" so people can add external GUI objects
number boxes to darken for typing and/or received messages
new message box look
dialog to give values of $1, ... for the canvas
bang at end of line~, tabwrite~, etc.
should sys_bail kill all "threads" on the way out?
allow backslashes (or else really disallow them)
icon & desktop integration
tools (reassigns meaning of primary click)

code style improvements:
-Wno-unused to -Wno-unused-paramter and clean up unused automatic variables
rewrite t_getbytes properly (m_newmemory.c in pd/attic)
obj_new should do a longjmp on out-of-memory
