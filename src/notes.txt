  binbuf_read_via_canvas in x_qlist.c

PC device counting problem (first device invoked by -audiodev 0)

test:
compile on various versions of linux
windows:
  modal dialogs confuse watchdog
  check the right-click-on-empty-canvas
  MIDI I/O (inc. sysex)
  "-audiodev" with no args in registry can't start up?
mac:
  clicking on windows seems sometimes not to open them
what does OSX do when jack is compiled into Pd but not installed??
turn on paMacCore_ChangeDeviceParameters for mac (pa_mac_core.h)
Gnome: why don't windows pop up when clicked on?

problems:
fix declare to update current patch when changed
objects on GOP don't erase if you edit the GOP while they're showing
MSTACKSIZE limitation in m_binbuf.c
add -stack option to make 'regular' stack larger
TK menu on Windows says "wish"
activating windows in Gnome?
help browser broke on Panurge
offer both new and old help browser style
look again at array vis/invis conundrum, g_template.c
TK commands to nonexistent windows? (occasionally still happens)
still can't detect when a window is moved or resized
open_via_path call in d_soundfile.c isn't threadsafe
crashed Pd putting vec and template in wrong order in array element of struct
floor, ciel functions in expr misdeclared
graph names don't appear until graph moved? (invis/vis on new array/rename)
don't filter locked click() through getrect
when retyping abstractions, offer to save dirty one
should linux stop grabbing focus on vis?  Is there a way to detect whether
    the mouse is in a window when it opens?
arrays that don't fit in bounds don't update (same as red rectangle problem?)
look in d_resample.pd to understand inlet~ upsampling...
patcher inlets don't deal with scalars (zbug.pd)
check if there's a problem loading libs on startup if superuser
read xx.txt in "bad" gives warnings
Krzysztof's qlist_next reentrancy bug
don't draw in/outlets on gui objects in graph-on-parent
get rid of messages causing renaming; try to prevent patches closing themselves.
scofo reports error on reading score1.txt
loading e-mailed patches without removing headers crashes pd
check if _vsnprintf with zero argument in windows works any better...
detect adc~ and dac~ reblocking

more demonstration patches:
vibrato using variable delay
real-time spectrum grapher
document ||, |, etc, better

features:
clickles connection (hit 'c' key or something)
messages to suppress menus&accelerators, and invisibilize Pd window
machine-independent fonts
callback scheduling on Mac
sigmund~: sort by pitch; one-shot
add -x flag to drawnumbers....
grab new ALSA midi code from devel
externs able to usurp built-ins (+mem alignment for SSE)
replace gatom_escapit with a quoting mechanism (handle '[', spaces, etc.)
unicode in filenames???  How does this work?  (bug report about windows)
sprout inlet for "route", "sel" if one arg
more list functions (see x_list.c)
poly inlet to turn stealing on/off, plus mode to handle note-with-duration
integrate video into tilde objects
graph "hide name" flag controllable from dialog
"installation mode" - turn off Pd window, accelerators, menu bars, scrollbars
fix copyright notices
pixel font sizes
pd to find running ones (pd -new to defeat)
tables:
    if there's just one array, don't do stringent hit check.
    array click protection (Krzysztof's suggestion)
    make graph labels persistent and add to dialog
    object to get/set table size; random; quantile
    flag to hide array names 
think of a way to embed abstractions in a patch
make watchdog work for MACOSX
pasting should look at current mouse location
delete-in-rectangle message to Pds
put serial object in main dist (see rat@telecoma, Apr. 25; winfried May 22)
open/save panel to take messages to init directory, and to set extent list
flags to defeat pre-loading specified classes
expr to parse exponential notation
pipe to handle symbols&pointers (just takes floats now???)
fix "system" (google CLOEXEC alsa)
editing:
    "enter" into object box to create new one (also, change border? forking?)
    tab to jump to a connected object (first one?) (shift-tab to back up?)
    arrow keys to shift connections left and right
    menu item to connect selected objects
    highlight connections (and I/Os) on mouse motion
    select line and hit "insert" to interpolate an object
    option-drag an outlet to make a new, connected object
    (also, a way to make multiple connections?)

data:
make a 2-pass proecss for finding hot spot closes to any given click
replace list element with binbuf??
hooks for table mousing, other changes (scalars?)
data to save as succession of "list" messages that textfile can store, etc.
implement list field (GOP or subwindow, perhaps GOP could suppress bounds rect?)
data copy/paste doesn't check templates aren't changed
arrays of non-existent templates crash
vget, vset traversal objects, pointer == and select equivalents
cursor to show (x, y) location
improve typing at drawnumbers
sublists should display on parent if desired? (new drawing instruction)
test and debug list elements of templates
sublists seem not to handle canvas allocation right (get.pd->pointer.pd bug)
append doesn't do symbols yet.

netsend separate thread
netreceive (and netsend?) message to set port number
